    schema:description """Johan Andrés Mojica Palacio (born 21 August 1992) is a Colombian professional footballer who plays for as a left-back for La Liga club Mallorca and the Colombia national team.\r
\r
Mojica began his football career in Colombia with second division side Academia before joining league counterpart Llaneros in 2012. Over the next two years, he had loan periods with Deportivo Cali and La Liga side Rayo Vallecano. In 2014, Mojica was permanently signed by Rayo, however, he did not play much games with the club and was loaned out that same year to Real Valladolid. Notably, Mojica was included in the 2014–15 Segunda División Team of the Year for his efforts with Valladolid. In January 2017, he was loaned to second-tier club Girona FC, where he helped the team achieve promotion to the first division. Consequently, Mojica's loan was renewed for a further year and he eventually signed a four-year contract with the club in June 2018. He was loaned out to Serie A side Atalanta in September 2020, with a buyout clause. In January 2021, his loan with the club was terminated early and Mojica returned to Spain on loan, joining La Liga side Elche CF for the remainder of that season. That same year, Mojica was bought outright by Elche and signed a three-year contract with the club. In September 2022, he moved to Villarreal on a four-year contract.\r
\r
Mojica made his senior debut for Colombia in March 2015, and was chosen by José Pékerman for the 2018 FIFA World Cup."""@en ;
