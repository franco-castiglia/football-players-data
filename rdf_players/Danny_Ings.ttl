    schema:description """Daniel William John Ings is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for EFL Championship club Sheffield United. \r
\r
Ings started his career in the youth team of Southampton but was released as a schoolboy. He subsequently joined AFC Bournemouth, progressing through their youth system, while also spending time at Dorchester Town on loan. In 2011, Ings joined Burnley with whom he won the 2013–14 Championship Player of the Year, and helped them achieve promotion to the Premier League. Following Burnley's relegation, and the expiry of his contract with the club, Ings moved to Liverpool in the summer of 2015, but his first season at Anfield was ended after two months due to injury. His second season with Liverpool was also mired by injury, with Ings only making two League Cup appearances throughout the 2016–17 season. Ings joined Southampton on loan in August 2018, with his move made permanent on 1 July 2019 after Southampton decided to take the option to buy him based on a clause in the loan deal.\r
\r
Formerly an under-21 international, Ings made his senior debut for England in October 2015."""@en ;
