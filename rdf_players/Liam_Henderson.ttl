    schema:description """Liam Henderson (born 25 April 1996) is a Scottish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Italian club Palermo on loan from FC Empoli.\r
\r
Henderson joined Celtic as a youth and progressed through the club's development squad before making his competitive first team debut in December 2013. He played in Celtic's winning 2015 Scottish League Cup Final team, before going out on three-month loan to Tippeligaen side Rosenborg. The Norwegian club went on to win a domestic league and cup double, and Henderson played enough games for him to earn winner's medals in both competitions. He then went on loan to Hibernian for most of the 2015–16 season, helping the club win the 2015–16 Scottish Cup. Henderson then rejoined the Celtic squad, but made few first-team appearances.\r
\r
He was transferred to Serie B club Bari in January 2018, then moved to Hellas Verona as a free agent a few months later after Bari were declared bankrupt. He helped Verona to promotion, and in August 2019 became the first Scot to play in a Serie A match since Graeme Souness in 1986.\r
\r
Henderson has represented Scotland at various youth levels, including captaining the under-17 team."""@en ;
