    schema:description """Elseid Gëzim Hysaj (born 2 February 1994) is an Albanian professional footballer who plays as a right-back for Italian club Lazio and the Albania national team. Hysaj can operate on both sides of the pitch as a full-back.\r
\r
Hysaj was born in Albania and started youth career with KF Shkodra, a local team of Shkodër city, but joined his father in Italy at the age of 14, where he joined Empoli's youth setup in 2009, before going on to make his debut for the club in 2011 in the Coppa Italia. He made his league debut the following season in Serie B, and he quickly became the club's starting right back under the guidance of head coach Maurizio Sarri, making 34 league appearances during the 2012–13 campaign before going on to secure promotion with Empoli the following season. During his debut season in Serie A he had an impressive campaign, where he featured in 36 league games as his side comfortably avoided relegation. At the end of the season Sarri left as head coach and joined Napoli, where Hysaj soon followed in a €6million move, making it the second most expensive move involving an Albanian international behind of Lorik Cana which currently holds the record with a €6,75 million move from Galatasaray to Lazio in July 2011."""@en ;
