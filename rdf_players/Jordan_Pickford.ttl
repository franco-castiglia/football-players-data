    schema:description """Jordan Lee Pickford (né Logan; born 7 March 1994) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Everton and the England national team.\r
\r
Pickford has previously played for Sunderland's academy, reserve, and senior teams in addition to loan spells at Darlington, Alfreton Town, Burton Albion, Carlisle United, Bradford City and Preston North End. He signed for Everton for a fee of £25 million in June 2017.\r
\r
Pickford has represented England at under-16, under-17, under-18, under-19, under-20 and under-21 levels. He made his debut for the full England national team in November 2017 in a friendly against Germany. He was the starting goalkeeper in England's 2018 FIFA World Cup fourth-place finish, in which the squad reached its first semi-final appearance since 1990. He also started in England's Euro 2020 runners-up finish, in which England reached their first ever Euro final and first major tournament final since 1966. Starting every game in the group stage, Pickford conceded no goals.\r
\r
Pickford was born in Washington, Tyne and Wear, where he attended St Robert of Newminster Catholic School. He grew up supporting his local football club, Sunderland.\r
\r
Pickford and his wife have a son who was born in 2019.\r
\r
On 24 August 2017, Pickford was called up to the England squad by manager Gareth Southgate for two 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovakia. However, he later withdrew from the squad due to injury. Pickford made his debut in a friendly on 10 November 2017, starting as England drew 0–0 with Germany at Wembley Stadium.\r
\r
Pickford was named in the 23-man England national team squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He started the opening match against Tunisia, which England won 2–1. In their round of 16 match on 3 July, Pickford helped England beat Colombia 4–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw, saving from Carlos Bacca, to claim his nation's first World Cup penalty shoot-out victory and a place in the quarter-final.\r
\r
On 7 July 2018, Pickford kept his first clean sheet of the World Cup and was named man of the match, as England knocked out Sweden with a 2–0 win in the quarter-finals. The result earned England a place in the semi-finals of the World Cup for the first time since 1990.\r
\r
In June 2019, Pickford scored and then saved the decisive penalty as England beat Switzerland to finish third at the inaugural UEFA Nations League Finals. It was the second penalty shoot-out in a row that England had won, with Pickford saving penalties in both, and he became the first goalkeeper to take (and score) a penalty in a competitive shoot-out for England.\r
\r
On 1 June 2021, Pickford was named in the 26-man squad for the rescheduled UEFA Euro 2020. At the tournament, Pickford became the first goalkeeper in history to keep clean sheets in the first five games of a European Championship. On 7 July 2021, Pickford set an all-time England record for most consecutive scoreless minutes posted by a goalkeeper. He set the mark of 721 minutes midway through the first half Euro 2020 semi-final against Denmark, passing a record previously held by Gordon Banks (720 minutes). On 11 July 2021, Pickford saved 2 Italy penalties during the shoot-out in the Final, however, England lost 3–2 after missing their last three penalties."""@en ;
