    schema:description """Jesper Grænge Lindstrøm is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a winger for Bundesliga club VfL Wolfsburg, on loan from Serie A club Napoli. \r
\r
Lindstrøm made his full international debut for Denmark on 11 November 2020 against Sweden. He has also represented Denmark at under-19 and under-21 levels.\r
\r
On 9 November 2020, Lindstrøm was called up to Kasper Hjulmand's senior squad for the friendly against Sweden due to several cancellations from, among others, the Danish national team players playing in England, due to the COVID-19 restrictions, as well as a case of COVID-19 in the squad, which had put several national team players in quarantine. He came on as a substitute in the second-half during the match against Sweden at Brøndby Stadium in his debut match, on 11 November 2020."""@en ;
