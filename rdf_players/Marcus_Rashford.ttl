    schema:description """Marcus Rashford (born 31 October 1997) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for La Liga club Barcelona, on loan from Premier League club Manchester United, and the England national team.\r
\r
A product of the Manchester United youth system, Rashford joined the club at the age of seven. 18-year-old Rashford scored two goals on both his first-team and European debut against Midtjylland in the UEFA Europa League in February 2016 and his Premier League debut against Arsenal three days later. He also scored in his first Manchester derby, as well as on his EFL Cup and UEFA Champions League debuts. With United, Rashford has won two FA Cups, two EFL Cups, the FA Community Shield and the UEFA Europa League.\r
\r
Rashford scored on his England debut in May 2016, becoming the youngest English player to score in his first senior international match. He has since appeared at two UEFA European Championship; 2016, where he was the tournament's youngest player, and 2020, where he appeared in the final as England finished runners-up to Italy. He has also represented England at the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup.\r
\r
Rashford has been praised for using his platform to be a political activist and philanthropist to drive societal change. He is a campaigner against racism, homelessness and child hunger in the United Kingdom. He has been recognised for his efforts by organisations both within and outside of sport, and was the subject of a mural in Withington."""@en ;
