    schema:description """Kepa Arrizabalaga Revuelta, often referred to simply as Kepa, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Arsenal.\r
\r
Arrizabalaga began his senior club career with Basconia in 2011 but rejoined Athletic Bilbao in 2013. He played for Ponferradina and Real Valladolid on consecutive loans between 2015 and 2016, after which, he became a first-team regular at Bilbao; in 2018, he was the subject of a record association football transfer when he moved to Chelsea in a transfer worth €80 million (£72 million), a record fee for a goalkeeper. There, he won the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Champions League, and the UEFA Super Cup. After inconsistent performances, Kepa joined Real Madrid on loan in 2023, where he won La Liga and the Champions League.\r
\r
Arrizabalaga won the 2012 European Championship with Spain's under-19 team. He made his senior debut in 2017, and was part of the national squad for the 2018 World Cup, although he did not make an appearance in the tournament."""@en ;
