    schema:description """Reece James (born 8 December 1999) is an English professional footballer who plays as a right-back for Premier League club Chelsea and the England national team.\r
\r
James joined the Chelsea academy as a youth and turned professional in 2017, a season where he captained the under-18s to victory in the FA Youth Cup and was named Academy Player of the Season. A productive loan spell with Wigan Athletic of the Championship saw him promoted to the Chelsea first team upon his return in 2019, after which he began to establish himself as a regular fixture at right-back and earn a long-term contract extension in January 2020.\r
\r
After representing England at various youth levels, James was called up to the full international side for the first time in October 2020, earning his first cap against Wales."""@en ;
