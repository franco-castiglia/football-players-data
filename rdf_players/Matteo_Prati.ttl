    schema:description """Matteo Prati (born 28 December 2003) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Serie A club Cagliari.\r
\r
Prati made his senior professional debut for the club he was raised in, Ravenna in Serie C in March 2021. Following Ravenna's relegation to Serie D for the 2021â€“22 season, he became a regular member of the starting lineup.\r
\r
On 27 July 2022, Prati signed a three-year contract (with an option to extend for one more year) with SPAL in Serie B. He made his Serie B debut for SPAL on 3 September 2022 in a game against Bari. He made a good impact, but the team was relegated at the end of the season.\r
\r
On 17 August 2023, Prati officially joined Serie A club Cagliari for five million euros (plus two millions in add-ons), signing a five-year contract with the club. In the process, the deal broke the transfer record as the most lucrative sale from any Serie C team. He made his Serie A debut on 17 September 2023, playing as a starter in the match against Udinese."""@en ;
