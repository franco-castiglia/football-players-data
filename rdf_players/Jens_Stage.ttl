\r
Copenhagen\r
On 1 July 2019, FC Copenhagen announced, that they had signed Stage from AGF on a five-year contract, after he had rejected several offers from foreign clubs. Shortly after signing, in mid-July, Stage's apartment in Aarhus was subjected to vandalism and arson. An object has been thrown through a window and should, according to AGF, have been the cause of a "minor fire damage". FC Copenhagen distanced themselves from the vandalism on their official website. AGF offered their assistance to local police, who following the incident begun an investigation of the case. According to DR, no major damage was done to the apartment as the fire went out again shortly after it was ignited. AGF's chairman, Jacob Nielsen, stated on AGF's official website that if the perpetrators "are identified and it turns out that the perpetrators have some connection to our fan base, then they will – in addition to a civil sentence – get a lifelong suspension for all AGF's matches"."""@en ;
