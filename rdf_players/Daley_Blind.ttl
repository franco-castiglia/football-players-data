He has been deployed in a variety of defensive roles – as a defensive midfielder, left back and centre back. He is the son of former Ajax defender and former Netherlands national team manager Danny Blind.\r
\r
Blind rose through the youth ranks at Ajax, becoming a regular after a loan to Groningen, and won four consecutive Eredivisie titles with the club. In September 2014, he transferred to Manchester United for £13.8 million, where he was part of the team that won four trophies including the FA Cup, EFL Cup and UEFA Europa League. In the summer of 2018, Blind returned to Ajax, where he won his fifth Eredivisie title and a first-ever KNVB Cup in his first season back at the club. He won two more Eredivisie titles before moving to Bayern Munich, where he won the Bundesliga during a six-month spell. Blind signed for La Liga club Girona in 2023.\r
\r
A full Netherlands international from 2013 to 2024, Blind earned over 100 caps, and was a member of the Dutch squad that finished third at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He went on to feature at UEFA Euro 2020, the 2022 World Cup and Euro 2024."""@en ;
