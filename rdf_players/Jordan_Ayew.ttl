    schema:description """Jordan Pierre Ayew (born 11 September 1991) is a professional footballer who plays as a winger or forward for Premier League club Leicester City and the Ghana national team.\r
\r
Ayew began his professional career with Marseille, scoring on his senior debut in 2009. After short spells with fellow Ligue 1 clubs Sochaux and Lorient, Ayew was signed by English side Aston Villa in 2015, finishing his only full season as the team's top scorer as they was relegated from the Premier League; this feat was subsequently repeated with Swansea City in 2018. Following Swansea's relegation, Ayew was signed by Crystal Palace, going on to make over 200 appearances for the club.\r
\r
Born in France, Ayew made his senior debut for Ghana in 2010 and has since earned over 100 caps for his country. He has played for the national team in two FIFA World Cups (2014 and 2022), as well as six Africa Cup of Nations (2012, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023), helping them finish runners-up in 2015.\r
\r
Ayew is the son of former Ghana national football captain Abedi Pele, and the brother of fellow players André and Ibrahim Ayew."""@en ;
