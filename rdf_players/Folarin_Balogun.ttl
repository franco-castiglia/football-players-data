    schema:description """Folarin Jerry Balogun (born July 3, 2001) is an American professional soccer player who plays as a striker for Ligue 1 club Monaco and the United States national team.\r
\r
A Hale's End academy prospect of Arsenal, Balogun was promoted to the first team in 2020 and featured sparingly for the club, later going on loan to EFL Championship side Middlesbrough in 2022. In the following season, Balogun made his breakthrough in a loan to Ligue 1 side Reims, where he scored 21 goals in 37 appearances to be the French league's fourth top scorer of the season. In August 2023 Balogun left Arsenal and signed with Monaco for €40 million (£34m/€43m).\r
\r
Born in New York City, he represented both the United States and England at the youth international level. In May 2023, he made the decision to play for the United States senior national team. He made his debut in June 2023, winning the 2023 CONCACAF Nations League and scoring his first goal in the final."""@en ;
