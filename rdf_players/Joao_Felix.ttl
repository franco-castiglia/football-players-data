    schema:description """João Félix Sequeira (born 10 November 1999) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder or forward for Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr and the Portugal national team. \r
\r
Félix initially trained at Porto's youth academy, before moving to rivals Benfica in 2015. He began playing for the latter's reserve team a year later and was promoted to the first team in 2018, making his debut at age 17. He helped Benfica win the league title in his first and only season with them. In 2019, at age 19, Félix signed with Atlético Madrid for a club-record transfer worth €126 million (£113 million), the fourth-most expensive football transfer. With Atlético, he won the 2020–21 La Liga and over the following years, he had loan spells with Chelsea and Barcelona, before rejoining Chelsea permanently in 2024.\r
\r
Félix is a former Portugal youth international, representing his country at under-18, under-19, and under-21 levels. He earned his first cap for the senior national team during the semi-finals of the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals, winning the inaugural edition of the competition with his nation on home soil."""@en ;
