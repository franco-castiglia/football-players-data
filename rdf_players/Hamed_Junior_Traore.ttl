    schema:description """Hamed Junior Traorè is an Ivorian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Ligue 1 club Marseille, on loan from Bournemouth, and the Ivory Coast national team.\r
\r
Born in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Traorè moved to Italy at a young age.\r
\r
Traorè debuted for the Ivory Coast U23s in a pair of 2019 Africa U-23 Cup of Nations qualification matches in March 2019.\r
\r
He made his debut for the Ivory Coast national team on 6 September 2021 in a World Cup qualifier against Cameroon, a 2–1 home victory. He substituted Jérémie Boga in the 69th minute.\r
\r
In July 2020, an investigation into trafficking of football players was launched by the public prosecutor's office of Parma. Among the involved was Hamed Mamadou Traorè, a distant relative of Hamed and his alleged brother Amad Diallo, who was accused of posing as their father to facilitate their immigration to Italy. The investigation also questioned the relationship between Hamed and Amad.\r
\r
On 10 February 2021, Traorè was found guilty of violating the Italian Sports Justice Code in order to join the football club "ASD Boca Barco" in 2015 under the name "Hamed Junior Traorè". He was accused of falsifying documents in order to fake a relationship with Hamed Mamadou Traorè, an Ivorian citizen resident in Italy, and request a family reunification. Traorè requested a plea bargain, with the Federal Prosecutor's Office imposing a fine of €48,000."""@en ;
