    schema:description """Christian Dannemann Eriksen (born 14 February 1992) is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder.\r
Eriksen began his senior club career at age 18 in 2010, playing for Ajax, where he won three Eredivisie titles and the KNVB Cup. In 2013, Eriksen signed for Tottenham Hotspur in a transfer worth £11 million (€12.45 million), where he was twice named the club's Player of the Year, was voted into the 2017–18 PFA Team of the Year, and later also reached the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final. In 2020, Eriksen joined Inter Milan in a transfer worth €19.7 million (£16.9 million), and won a Serie A title prior to the mutual termination of his contract in 2021. Eriksen returned to the Premier League in 2022 with a move to Brentford.\r
\r
Eriksen made his senior international debut for Denmark in 2010 at age 18, and has since earned over 110 caps, including appearing in four major tournaments; he was also the youngest player at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Eriksen is his country's fifth highest all-time goalscorer, and was named Danish Football Player of the Year a record five times. During a UEFA Euro 2020 match on 12 June 2021, Eriksen collapsed on the pitch after suffering a cardiac arrest due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM); he was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation and was later fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, and returned to football eight months later, eventually playing with Manchester United.\r
\r
Eriksen lives with his girlfriend Sabrina Kvist Jensen. They have two children, a son and a daughter. His younger sister Louise Eriksen also plays football and is the captain for KoldingQ in the Elitedivisionen."""@en ;
