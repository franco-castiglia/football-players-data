    schema:description """Adam James Smith (born 29 April 1991) is an English footballer who plays for Bournemouth. He has also represented England at under-21 level. He is a defender who is economical with possession.\r
\r
Smith is a product of the Tottenham Hotspur youth academy.\r
\r
On 23 September 2010, Smith joined Bournemouth on a month loan deal. He started his spell against Carlisle United in a game in which he won a sixty-fourth-minute penalty, which new team-mate Michael Symes scored. The game finished 2–0 to Bournemouth and left them third in the table.\r
\r
Smith was then part of the Bournemouth side who lost 2–0 at St Mary's in a south coast derby with Southampton. The youngster was sent off late on following two bookable offences. He missed the trip to Brighton & Hove Albion but returned for Bournemouth's 3–2 win against MK Dons, maintaining his 100% win ratio. This run was brought to an end when Smith played in a 2–1 defeat against Colchester United at Dean Court on 30 October 2010. On 1 April, Smith scored his first goal for Bournemouth an equalizer in the 94TH minute against Peterborough United at London Road helping the cherries come back from 3–1 down with 20 minutes to go after Steve Fletcher's bullet header made the score 3-2.\r
\r
On 28 January 2014, Smith re-joined Bournemouth this time on a permanent basis signing a three-and-a-half year deal. On the 19th December 2015, he scored for the club in a 2-1 away win against West Bromwich Albion.\r
\r
Smith has represented England at various youth team levels."""@en ;
