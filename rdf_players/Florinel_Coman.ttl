    schema:description """Florinel Teodor Coman (born 10 April 1998) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Serie A club Cagliari, on loan from Qatar Stars League club Al-Gharafa, and the Romania national team.\r
\r
Coman began his career at Viitorul Constanța in 2015, winning a national championship in his second full season with the club. In 2017, he transferred to FCSB in a deal eventually worth €3 million, representing the then-highest fee paid by a Liga I side. With FCSB, Coman won the Cupa României in 2019 and secured another national title in the 2023–24 campaign, during which he was the league's top scorer and named Player of the Season. Shortly after, he earned a €5.25 million transfer to Qatari team Al-Gharafa.\r
\r
Coman made his senior debut for Romania in October 2019, after previously being capped at under-17, under-19, and under-21 levels. He competed for the country in the UEFA Euro 2024, where the team won their group and reached the round of 16."""@en ;
