    schema:description """Gabriel André Joseph Charpentier (born 17 May 1999) is a Congolese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie A club Parma and the Congo national team.\r
\r
After being released from French top flight club Nantes, Charpentier decided to seek a move abroad because he thought "that in France, the path is a little more difficult to get there. Football is not easy".\r
\r
For the 2019 season, he signed for FK Spartaks Jūrmala in Latvia, despite being "really apprehensive at the start". Later that season, another French player joined the team, which boosted his confidence and motivation.\r
\r
In 2020, Charpentier signed for Genoa in the Italian Serie A, before being loaned to Reggina 1914 in the second division.\r
\r
On 1 February 2021, Charpentier moved to Serie B side Ascoli, on a loan deal until the end of the season.\r
\r
On 28 July 2021 he went to Frosinone on loan. In Frosinone the French player had a great season.\r
\r
On 30 August 2022, Charpentier signed with Parma.\r
\r
Charpentier was born in the Republic of the Congo to a French father and Congolese mother. He made himself available to play for the Congo national team in June 2022. He debuted for the Congo in a 2–1 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualification loss to South Sudan on 23 March 2023."""@en ;
