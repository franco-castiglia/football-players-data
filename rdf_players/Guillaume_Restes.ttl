    schema:description """Guillaume Restes (born 11 March 2005) is a French professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Ligue 1 club Toulouse.\r
\r
Club career\r
Born in Toulouse, Guillaume Restes joined the Toulouse FC academy as a six years old, from the club of the Montaudran suburb.\r
\r
He signed his first professional contract with the club on the summer 2021. His promising performances with the youth team and the National 3 reserve of Toulouse at a young age soon earned him comparisons to former Toulouse player Alban Lafont.\r
\r
During the 2023 pre-season, despite the arrival of LaLiga2 champion Álex Domínguez and the initial announcement of Coupe de France winner Kjetil Haug as the number 1 goalkeeper, Restes established himself as a potential starter for his club after the departure of Maxime Dupé, playing the entirety of the last summer friendly, a 2–1 home win against Mourinho's AS Roma.\r
\r
Restes made his professional debut for Toulouse on the 13 August 2023, playing the full 90 minutes of a 2–1 away Ligue 1 win to Nantes, the young goalkeeper earning praises for his decisive performance.\r
\r
International career\r
Guillaume Restes is a youth international for France, having played with the under-17 and under-18 teams.\r
\r
Having a mother of Ivorian descent, Restes is also potentially eligible for the Ivory Coast national team."""@en ;
