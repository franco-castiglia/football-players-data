\r
Brahim is a youth international for Spain, and made his first appearances at age 16, where he received praise for his performances for Spain's U17s in the 2016 UEFA European Under-17 Championship.\r
\r
Due to the isolation of some national team players following the positive COVID-19 test of Sergio Busquets, Spain's under-21 squad were called up for the international friendly against Lithuania on 8 June 2021. Brahim made his senior debut in the match and scored the second goal in a 4–0 victory against Lithuania. On January 27 2023, it was announced that Brahim planned to switch allegiances to the Morocco national team.\r
\r
Brahim, as he was born in Spain to Spanish parents of Moroccan origin from Melilla, was eligible to play for Morocco.\r
\r
On 15 October 2021, it was announced that Diaz had contracted COVID-19. By October 26 he had recovered."""@en ;
