    schema:description """Jonathan Grant Evans is a Northern Irish former professional footballer who played as a centre-back. He is currently the head of loans and pathways at Manchester United. \r
\r
Evans was born in Belfast and started his career at Greenisland FC, where he was spotted by Manchester United scouts. He progressed through Manchester United's academy and went on loan to Royal Antwerp and Sunderland to gain first-team experience before making his Manchester United first team debut in the 2007â€“08 League Cup. He became a regular first-team squad member the following season, and played almost 200 matches for Manchester United in an eight-year spell; however, he fell out of favour at the club under manager Louis van Gaal and left for West Bromwich Albion. When West Brom were relegated three years later, Evans signed for Leicester City. Evans is the second most decorated player in Northern Irish football history with 10 major trophies. He has also played 91 times for the Northern Ireland national team, and was ever present in the team's run to the round of 16 at UEFA Euro 2016."""@en ;
