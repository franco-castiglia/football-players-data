Early life\r
Alessandro Bianco was born in Turin, spending most of its youth in the Metropolitan City of Turin, in a family from Piedmont.\r
\r
A promising cyclist during his early years, Bianco started to play football as a 7-year-old in Orbassano, but soon joining Torino's academy, Juve's old rival. After progressing through the youth ranks of the club from his hometown, Bianco was not retained by Il Toro as an under-15, and went on to play with amateur side Chisola Calcio, in Vinovo.\r
