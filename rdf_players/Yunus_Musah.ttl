Club career\r
Early career\r
Born in New York City with Ghanaian descent, Musah moved to Italy with months of age, living in Castelfranco Veneto and starting his career at Giorgione Calcio 2000. In 2012, he moved to London and joined Arsenal's Academy.\r
\r
Valencia\r
In the 2019 summer, Musah joined Valencia CF and was assigned to the reserves in Segunda División B. He made his senior debut with the B-team at the age of 16 on 15 September 2019, starting in a 0–0 home draw against CF La Nucía. He scored his first senior goal the following 1 March, netting his team's only goal in a 1–2 loss at Gimnàstic de Tarragona.\r
\r
After the arrival of new manager Javi Gracia in Valencia's first team, Musah spent the 2020 pre-season with the main squad. He made his first team – and La Liga – debut on 13 September of that year, starting in a 4–2 home win against Levante UD; at the age of 17 years and eight months, he became the first Englishman to debut for the club.\r
\r
International career\r
Musah is eligible to play for the United States, Ghana, Italy (after living for ten years in the country) and England. He made his debut with the latter's under-15s in 2016."""@en ;
