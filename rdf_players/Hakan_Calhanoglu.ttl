    schema:description """Hakan Çalhanoğlu (born 8 February 1994) is a Turkish professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Serie A club Inter Milan and the Turkey national team.\r
\r
He began his career at German second division club Karlsruher in 2010 and moved to top-flight side Hamburg two years later, spending another season back at his first club on loan. His performance in his first Bundesliga season earned him a €14.5 million transfer to Bayer Leverkusen in 2014. He played for three seasons there, totalling 28 goals in 115 official appearances. In 2017, he signed for Milan for an initial €20 million fee.\r
\r
Born in Germany, Çalhanoğlu opted to represent Turkey at international level, from under-16 level onwards. He made his senior debut in 2013 and was part of their squad at UEFA Euro 2016 and Euro 2020."""@en ;
