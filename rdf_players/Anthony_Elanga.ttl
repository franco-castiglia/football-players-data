    schema:description """Anthony David Junior Elanga (born 27 April 2002) is a Swedish professional footballer who plays as a forward or winger for Premier League club Newcastle United and the Sweden national team. \r
Elanga played twice in the 2019–20 EFL Trophy with Manchester United's under-21 side, both as a substitute. He made his first-team debut for United in a pre-season friendly against Aston Villa ahead of the 2020–21 Premier League season; he came on as a substitute for Marcus Rashford in the 75th minute of a 1–0 defeat. He played four times for the club's under-21 side in the 2020–21 EFL Trophy, scoring twice, and was called up to the first team for the 2020–21 UEFA Europa League quarter-final matches against Granada in April 2021, but was an unused substitute in both legs. He made his competitive debut for the club on 11 May 2021 in a Premier League match against Leicester City; a rescheduled match against Liverpool meant they had to play four matches in the space of seven days, resulting in manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær making 10 changes to the side he had named for the previous match against Aston Villa two days earlier. Elanga was replaced by Marcus Rashford in the 66th minute as United lost 2–1. With United's league position secure and Solskjær resting his best players ahead of the 2021 UEFA Europa League Final, Elanga started again away to Wolverhampton Wanderers on the final day of the league season and scored his first goal for Manchester United after just 13 minutes."""@en ;
