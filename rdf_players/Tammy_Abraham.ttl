    schema:description """Kevin Oghenetega Tamaraebi Bakumo-Abraham (born 2 October 1997), known as Tammy Abraham, is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for Serie A club AC Milan, on loan from Roma. He also plays for the England national team. \r
As an academy graduate of Chelsea, Abraham made his senior debut for the club in 2016 before spending a season on loan with Championship club Bristol City. There, he enjoyed a successful campaign which culminated in him winning the club's Player of the Season, Young Player of the Season and top goalscorer awards, becoming the first player ever to do so in a single season. A further loan spell at Swansea City followed for Abraham but the season ended with the club suffering relegation from the Premier League. He then joined Aston Villa in 2018 and became the first player since 1977 to score 25 goals in a single campaign for the club.\r
\r
Formerly an England youth international, Abraham represented the nation from under-18 level, and featured at the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Poland. He made his senior debut in November 2017."""@en ;
