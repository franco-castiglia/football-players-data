    schema:description """Paulo Daniel Dentello Azzi (born 15 July 1994) is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a left-back or a winger for Italian Serie A club Cagliari.\r
\r
Born in Bragança Paulista, Azzi joined Paulista's youth setup in 2008, aged 13. In July 2013 he was promoted to the first-team ahead of that year's Copa Paulista. He also appeared three times in the competition, all from the bench.\r
\r
On 31 January 2014, Azzi joined Italian Serie B side A.S. Cittadella. On 15 March he made his professional debut, starting and assisting Juan Surraco in the winner against Carpi at Pier Cesare Tombolato; seven days later he scored his first professional goal, netting his side's second of a 4–0 routing at Padova.\r
\r
On 11 July 2020, he moved to Serie D club Seregno.\r
\r
On 1 February 2021, he returned to Serie C and signed with Lecco.\r
\r
On 3 July 2021, Azzi signed a two-year contract with fellow Serie C side Modena. He made his debut on 6 September in a 1–1 league draw against Reggiana as a late substitute for Alessandro Marotta. On 31 October, he scored his first goal for the club in the injury time of a 2–0 home win over Carrarese. The Brazilian eventually contributed to Modena's direct promotion to Serie B after six years.\r
\r
After spending the first half of the 2022–23 season as a regular starter at Modena, on 12 January 2023 Azzi officially joined fellow Serie B club Cagliari for an undisclosed fee, signing a contract until June 2025, with an option for another year. He subsequently made his debut two days later, starting and scoring a goal in a 2–0 league win against Como.["""@en ;
