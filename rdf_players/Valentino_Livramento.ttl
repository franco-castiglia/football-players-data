Early life\r
Born in Croydon, Livramento joined Chelsea at under-9 level from local club Roundshaw. Growing up, he supported Chelsea.\r
\r
Club career\r
Chelsea\r
He was named Chelsea academy player of the year for the 2020–21 season. Towards the end of the season, Livramento featured on the bench in Premier League fixtures against Manchester City and Arsenal.\r
\r
In July 2021, contract talks between Chelsea and Livramento stalled, with rumours that the wing-back was set to leave the club. He was reportedly subject to interest from a host of English clubs, including South Coast rivals Southampton and Brighton & Hove Albion, as well as A.C. Milan and RB Leipzig.\r
\r
Southampton\r
Having failed to reach an agreement with Chelsea, Livramento signed for fellow Premier League side Southampton in August 2021. Chelsea included a buy-back clause in the deal, reportedly worth £25 million. On 14 August 2021, Livramento made his first Premier League appearance for Southampton in a 3–1 defeat to Everton.\r
\r
International career\r
Livramento has represented England up to under-20 level, and captained the England under-17 side. His father's side of the family comes from Portugal."""@en ;
