    schema:description """Valentin Mihai Mihăilă (Romanian pronunciation: ; born 2 February 2000) is a Romanian professional footballer who plays as a winger for Serie A club Parma and the Romania national team.\r
\r
He began his professional career at Universitatea Craiova in 2017, appearing in over 60 matches in the Liga I before signing for Italian team Parma three years later.\r
\r
Internationally, Mihăilă recorded his full debut for Romania in a 3–2 win over North Macedonia in March 2021. He previously represented the nation at under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels.\r
\r
Mihăilă attracted significant media attention after contributing to Romania national under-21 team's victory in a UEFA Euro 2021 qualifier against Finland on 14 November 2019, as he scored a hat-trick and provoked an own goal.\r
\r
In March 2021, he was called up for the first time to the Romania senior team by coach Mirel Rădoi for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against North Macedonia, Germany and Armenia. On the 25th that month, Mihăilă replaced injured Florinel Coman in the first half of the former game and netted in the 3–2 win at the Arena Națională in Bucharest.\r
\r
On 19 June 2023, Mihăilă came on in the second half of a Euro 2024 qualifier against Switzerland and scored a late double to earn his team a 2–2 draw. He was then meant to join up with the under-21 squad for the 2023 European Championship, but was ruled out after suffering an injury in the latter game."""@en ;
