    schema:description """José Luis Gayà Peña (born 25 May 1995) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a left back for Valencia CF.\r
\r
An academy graduate of Valencia, he made his senior debut in 2012 and went on to play in more than 75 competitive matches for the club.\r
\r
Born in Pedreguer, Alicante, Valencian Community, Gayà was a product of Valencia CF's youth system, where he started playing as a striker – scoring over 60 goals in one year – before switching to left back. He made his senior debuts with the reserves at not yet 17, playing 21 minutes in a 1–0 away win against Andorra CF for the Segunda División B championship. It would be his only appearance of the season.\r
\r
On 30 October 2012, Gayà appeared in his first official game with the main squad, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–0 win at UE Llagostera for the campaign's Copa del Rey. He made his first appearance in the UEFA Europa League on 12 December of the following year, in a 1–1 group stage home draw against FC Kuban Krasnodar.\r
\r
Gayà played his first game in La Liga with the Che on 27 April 2014, starting and featuring the full 90 minutes in a 0–1 home loss against eventual champions Atlético Madrid. On 3 August, he scored the first goal in a 3–1 win over S.L. Benfica in that year's Emirates Cup.\r
\r
Gayà was made a starter by new manager Nuno Espírito Santo in 2014–15. He scored his first goal as a professional and in the Spanish top flight on 25 September 2014, grabbing his team's second in a 3–0 home success against Córdoba CF. His second came in the domestic cup on 7 January of the following year, helping to a 2–1 win over RCD Espanyol also at the Mestalla Stadium.\r
\r
On 8 May 2015, Gayà renewed his contract with the club, signing until 2020 with a €50 million release clause.\r
\r
Gayà earned 23 caps for Spain all youth levels comprised. On 26 May 2015, he was called to the full side for a friendly with Costa Rica and a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match against Belarus, but did not make his debut on either occasion."""@en ;
