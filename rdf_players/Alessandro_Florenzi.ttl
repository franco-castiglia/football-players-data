    schema:description """Alessandro Florenzi Cavaliere OMRI (born 11 March 1991) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a full-back for Serie A club AC Milan and the Italy national team.\r
\r
Florenzi started his professional club career with Roma in 2011, but spent the 2011–12 season on loan with Crotone. Florenzi was appointed as Roma's new captain following the departure of Daniele De Rossi in 2019. He later had spells on loan with Spanish side Valencia, and French side Paris Saint-Germain, winning the Trophée des Champions and the Coupe de France with the latter club during the 2020–21 season.\r
\r
At international level he was a member of the Italy national under-21 football team that finished second in the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, and also represented the Italy senior side at UEFA Euro 2016 and UEFA Euro 2020, winning the latter tournament.\r
\r
On 14 November 2012, Florenzi made his debut for the senior team under coach Cesare Prandelli in a friendly match against France.\r
\r
Florenzi was part of the Italy under-21 squad for the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Israel, as the Azzurrini reached the final, losing to Spain 4–2. Florenzi's only goal of the tournament came in the 4–0, group stage, victory over the host nation.\r
\r
On 15 October 2013, Florenzi scored his first senior goal on his competitive debut in a World Cup qualifying match against Armenia that ended in a 2–2 draw at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples. Florenzi was not included in the 30-man preliminary squad named by Cesare Prandelli for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.\r
\r
On 30 August 2014, new Italy head coach Antonio Conte named Florenzi in his first squad for the upcoming European qualifying matches. On 31 May 2016, he was named to Conte's 23-man Italy squad for UEFA Euro 2016.\r
\r
In June 2021, he was included in Italy's squad for UEFA Euro 2020 by manager Roberto Mancini. On 11 July, Florenzi won the European Championship with Italy following a 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory over England at Wembley Stadium in the final, after a 1–1 draw in extra-time; he made a substitute appearance during the final, replacing Emerson Palmieri late in the second half of extra-time."""@en ;
