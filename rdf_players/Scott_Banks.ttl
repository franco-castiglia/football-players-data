    schema:description """Scott Brian Banks is a Scottish professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder or winger for EFL League One club Blackpool, on loan from Bundesliga club St. Pauli.\r
\r
Banks began his career in Scotland with Dundee United, and has also played for Clyde, Alloa Athletic and Dunfermline Athletic on loan. He made his debut for the Scotland under-21 team in 2021.\r
\r
Early life\r
Banks comes from Linlithgow, West Lothian, and attended the Scottish Football Association performance school at Graeme High School in Falkirk.\r
\r
Club career\r
Banks joined Dundee United at youth level from Linlithgow Rose Community Football Club in 2013. After being top scorer for the United under-17 team the previous season, he signed his first professional contract with the club in 2018.\r
\r
In February 2019, Banks joined League Two club Clyde on loan for the rest of the 2018–19 season, quickly becoming a "fans' favourite". He scored the club's goal of the season against Peterhead and was man of the match against Annan Athletic in the match that secured Clyde's promotion from League Two.\r
\r
After impressing manager Robbie Neilson in pre-season matches, Banks made his Dundee United debut as a substitute against Heart of Midlothian in the Scottish League Cup in July 2019. The following month, United reportedly turned down a £400,000 transfer bid for Banks from Premier League club Crystal Palace. Following this, Banks rejected a new contract offer from Dundee United and was left out of the squad by Neilson.\r
\r
In January 2020, Banks signed a three year contract with Crystal Palace. Later in January, Palace loaned Banks to Alloa Athletic until the end of the 2019–20 season.\r
\r
In January 2021, Banks was signed on a loan deal by Scottish Championship side Dunfermline Athletic until the end of the 2020–21 Season.\r
\r
On 8 August 2022, Banks joined EFL League Two club Bradford City on a season-long loan. At the end of his successful loan spell with the Bantams he was awarded the Supporters Trust Young Player of the Year.\r
\r
On 10 August 2023, Banks moved on a new loan to St. Pauli in German 2. Bundesliga. After just three substitute appearances, Banks suffered a serious knee injury on 1 September 2023. He returned to the side as a substitute in the last game of the season, providing a crucial late assist to the winning goal as St. Pauli clinched the Bundesliga 2 title."""@en ;
