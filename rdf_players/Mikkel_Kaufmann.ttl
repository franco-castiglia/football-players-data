\r
FC Copenhagen\r
On 24 January 2020 Danish Superliga champions FC Copenhagen announced, that they had signed AaB topscorer Kaufmann from the summer 2020. However, after Carlo Holse was sold from Copenhagen, the club decided to bring him in immediately on the last day of the winter transfer market. The fee was rumored to be about 20 million DKK plus an additional 1,5 million DKK to sign him immediately. Kaufmann's transfer became the third biggest deal in the history of AaB."""@en ;
