\r
Rémy Joseph Cabella was born on 8 March 1990 in Ajaccio, Corsica, to an Italian father and a Corsican mother. He started his youth career at local club Gazélec Ajaccio before joining Montpellier's academy at the age of 14, winning the 2009 Coupe Gambardella with their under-19 team.\r
\r
Cabella was named on the stand-by list for France's 2014 FIFA World Cup squad. He made his international debut coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for Yohan Cabaye in a 4–0 friendly match win over Norway on 28 May 2014 at the Stade de France. On 6 June, Cabella replaced the injured Franck Ribéry in France's 2014 World Cup squad. The team lost to Germany in the quarter-finals on 4 July, and Cabella did not enter the field of play in all of their five matches in that tournament.\r
