    schema:description """Darwin Gabriel Núñez Ribeiro is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a forward for Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal and the Uruguay national team. \r
\r
Núñez came through Peñarol's youth academy, being promoted to the first team in 2017. In August 2019, he joined Spanish Segunda División side Almería. Benfica signed him in 2020 for a club-record transfer worth €24 million, the most expensive signing in Portuguese football history. In his second season, he won the Bola de Prata for top scorer in the Primeira Liga with 26 goals in 28 games. Liverpool signed him in 2022 for £64 million, potentially rising up to a few of £85 million, which could possibly make him the club's record signing in the future.\r
\r
After representing Uruguay at various youth levels, Núñez was called up to the full international side for the first time in October 2019. He scored on his international debut against Peru."""@en ;
