    schema:description """Rodrigo Hernández Cascante (born 22 June 1996), known as Rodri or Rodrigo, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder for Premier League club Manchester City and the Spain national team. Known for his passing, playmaking and physical attributes, he is widely regarded as one of the best players in the world.\r
\r
After stints with Villarreal and Atlético Madrid in La Liga, Rodri joined Premier League club Manchester City in 2019. He helped the team win four consecutive league titles in the 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23, and 2023–24 seasons. In the 2022–23 season, he was an integral part of the team which claimed a historic continental treble. This treble included City's first UEFA Champions League title, with Rodri scoring the only goal in the final, being named the tournament's Player of the Season.\r
\r
Rodri is a Spain international and former youth international. He made his debut for the senior national team in 2018 and represented his country at UEFA Euro 2020, the 2022 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2024. He won the UEFA Nations League in 2023, being named the best player of the finals tournament, and was an integral part in Spain's victory at Euro 2024, for which he was named Player of the Tournament.\r
\r
Rodri has won several individual awards, most notably the 2024 Ballon d'Or. He became the second male Spanish player to achieve this feat after Luis Suárez, who did so in 1960. He was also the first Manchester City player to win the award."""@en ;
