Almirón played for the Paraguay under-20 national team in the 2013 South American Youth Football Championship in Argentina, and was highly involved as his team finished second to Colombia. Later that year, he was called up for the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Turkey, where Paraguay reached the last 16.

In March 2019, in a friendly against Mexico at Levi's Stadium, Almirón came on as a substitute. Seven minutes later, he received a straight red card for a foul on José Juan Vázquez in which he dragged his studs down the back of the opponent's leg.

In 2011, Acerbi signed with Chievo Verona, thus making his Serie A debut. Despite being used only sporadically, Acerbi managed to draw the attention of A.C. Milan, who signed him the next summer. Having appeared in just 10 games for the rossoneri, Acerbi was sent back on loan to Chievo to complete the season. In 2013, he signed with Sassuolo, promoted to the Serie A for the first time in the club's history. During his debut season for the club he was diagnosed with testicular cancer and successfully cured by the end of campaign, which paved the way for his return to the pitch in September 2014. In 2018, having made 173 appearances in all competitions for the neroverdi, Acerbi transferred to Lazio, where he continued to be a starting defender.

He is currently a free agent having been released by West Ham United in 2025. 

Antonio began his career at non-League club Tooting & Mitcham United before signing with Reading of the Championship in 2008. The club sent him on subsequent loan spells to Cheltenham Town, back to Tooting & Mitcham, Southampton and Colchester United, as he struggled to find a place in Reading's first team throughout his four-year stay at the Madejski. A final loan spell with Sheffield Wednesday resulted in a permanent move in 2012, where he went on to make 64 appearances and score 12 goals. Nottingham Forest signed him from Wednesday in 2014, where his 16 goals in 50 appearances attracted attention from West Ham United of the Premier League, who signed him in 2015, where he was deployed in a number of positions including right back, right midfielder and as a winger before eventually establishing himself as the club's main striker. On 23 August 2021, he became West Ham United's all-time top scorer in the Premier League.

In March 2016, Antonio revealed that he had rejected the opportunity to play for Jamaica internationally and that he harboured an ambition of playing for England.

On 28 August 2016, in new England manager Sam Allardyce's first squad, Antonio was called up for the first time, for a 2018 World Cup qualification match against Slovakia in Slovakia on 4 September 2016 where he was an unused substitute. On 16 March 2017, Antonio was called up by new England manager Gareth Southgate's squad for the friendly match against Germany on 22 March and the 2018 World Cup qualifier against Lithuania on 26 March; however, on 20 March, Antonio withdrew from the squad after picking up a hamstring injury.

In February 2021, Antonio was again approached by Jamaica to consider playing for them at international level. He was said to be passionate about playing and helping them reach the 2022 World Cup. In March 2021, Antonio was reported to be in the process of obtaining his Jamaican passport. On 17 March 2021, it was reported that Antonio had decided he was going to represent Jamaica internationally, ahead of the squad being announced for an upcoming international friendly against the United States. Despite this, Antonio was not included in the 19-man squad when this was announced on 17 March. The BBC reported that Antonio was still to decide whether to switch. TalkSPORT reported on the same day that he had pledged to play for Jamaica.

On 18 June 2021, Antonio was named in Jamaica's 60-man provisional squad for the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup. Antonio missed out on the final 23-man squad, by virtue of not having secured his Jamaican passport in time. In August 2021, The Athletic reported Antonio had received his passport, making him eligible to play for the country. He was subsequently called up for a 35-man squad for upcoming World Cup fixtures against Mexico, Panama and Costa Rica although COVID-19 travel restrictions do not allow him to enter either Mexico or Costa Rica. He debuted with Jamaica in a 3–0 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification loss to Panama on 5 September 2021. His debut lasted 70 minutes. He spent much of the game isolated with little service from his team on what was described as a hard and dry pitch. Antonio scored his first goal for Jamaica in his second international appearance. In a World Cup qualifying game against El Salvador on 13 November, Antonio scored the opening goal before Alex Roldan equalised for El Salvador as the game finished 1–1.

Antonio is married and has four children.

In February 2019, Antonio suggested that clubs whose fans engage in racial abuse should be deducted points.

Early life and education
Chandler was born in Frankfurt am Main, West Germany to an American father who was born in New York City and served in the U.S. military, and a German mother. His father and mother separated shortly after his birth. He continued to live with his mother in Germany.

Career
1. FC Nürnberg
Chandler began his career at Sportfreunde Oberau as well as time with Eintracht Frankfurt before transferring to 1. FC Nürnberg in the summer of 2010. He made his debut for the first team of 1. FC Nürnberg on January 15, 2011 against Borussia Mönchengladbach. On February 12, 2011, he scored the first goal of his professional career against VfB Stuttgart.

Chandler made his first appearance of the 2011–12 season on July 30, 2011, providing an assist for Markus Feulner's equalizing goal in an eventual 5–1 triumph over Arminia Bielefeld in the first round of the DFB-Pokal. Chandler's debut appearance of the year's Bundesliga campaign came a week later on August 6, playing the full ninety minutes of a narrow 1–0 defeat of Hertha BSC. Chandler netted his only goal of the campaign on November 26 against FC Kaiserslautern, blasting the ball in from the edge of the area, securing a 1–0 win and the club's first victory in eight games. Two weeks later on December 10, the referee adjudged Chandler's challenge on Sejad Salihović as too strong and the American was given a red card; down to ten man, Nürnberg fell to a 2–0 loss with both goals coming from Vedad Ibišević. Things turned worse for Chandler and Nürnberg two days later, as the defender was at fault for conceding the only goal of the game against SpVgg Greuther Fürth in the third round of the DFB-Pokal, eliminating his side from the competition.

In Nürnberg's 4–1 win over Schalke on April 11, 2012, Chandler provided his second assist of the season, finding midfielder Daniel Didavi who made it 3–0. Chandler made his 30th, 29 of which were starts, and final appearance of the Bundesliga season on April 28 in Nürnberg's 3–2 defeat of Hoffenheim, taking revenge for his red card and the club's loss earlier in the season. Nürnberg finished the season in a respectable tenth place in the Bundesliga and Chandler attracted interest from many clubs, including VfB Stuttgart. However, Chandler decided to reject the overtures from other German clubs and signed a contract extension with Nürnberg, tying him to the club until July 2015.

Chandler's first appearance in the 2012–13 season came in Nürnberg's humbling 3–2 defeat to fifth division side TSV Havelse in the first round of the DFB-Pokal on August 19, 2012. His only goal of the campaign came against Hannover 96 on September 26, scoring a consolation goal as his side fell to a 4–1 defeat. Chandler again made 30 Bundesliga appearances, 29 from the start, as Nürnberg finished the league in tenth position on 44 points.

Eintracht Frankfurt
After Nürnberg were relegated at the end of the 2013–14 Bundesliga season, Chandler signed a three-year contract with his former club Eintracht Frankfurt on June 3, 2014.

International career
In March 2011 Chandler was selected by Bob Bradley as part of the United States's 24-man squad set to face Paraguay and Argentina in international friendlies. Chandler made his debut with the U.S. on March 26, 2011, playing the entire second half of a 1–1 draw against Argentina. On May 16, 2012, Timothy Chandler declined an offer from U.S. coach Jürgen Klinsmann to join his training camp for the upcoming friendlies and 2014 World Cup Qualifiers. Klinsmann stated that Timothy expressed a need to take a break from the U.S. and find his international identity. However, Chandler later accepted a call-up for the U.S. friendly against Russia, stating that he was ""in 1,000 percent."" On February 4, 2013, Jürgen Klinsmann named Chandler to the United States' 24-man roster for February 6, 2013 match at Honduras; his start against Honduras on February 6, 2013 ""cap-tied"" Chandler to the United States for all future international competitions, under FIFA rules.

Chandler did not feature for the United States until 15 months later when he was recalled by Klinsmann as part of the 30-man squad in preparation for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He was then selected to the final 23-man roster on May 22, 2014 for the finals in Brazil. Though he was on the final roster that went to Brazil, Chandler did not see any game action.

Chandler was again called up for the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup and started at right back in the opening game against Honduras.",,1.86 m (6 ft 1 in),United States,Timothy Chandler,Midfielder,Eintracht Frankfurt,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/9ixugx1578086897.jpg,,183 lbs,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q65297,,,,,,,,,

André Ayew is the second-born son of three-time African Footballer of the Year and FIFA 100 member Abedi ""Pele"" Ayew and has two brothers, Ibrahim and Jordan, who also are professional footballers. In 2011 Ayew was named the BBC African Footballer of the Year and Ghanaian Footballer of the Year.

Ayew began his career in Germany, playing for 1860 Munich, while debuting for the club at age seven. In 2006, he signed with his father's former club, Marseille, and spent two seasons in the club's youth academy before making his debut in the 2007–08 season. Ayew spent the following two seasons on loan with Lorient and Arles-Avignon, helping the latter team earn promotion to Ligue 1 for the first time. In 2010, he returned to Marseille and became an integral part of the first team under manager Didier Deschamps, making over 200 appearances and winning consecutive Trophée des Champions and Coupe de la Ligues in both 2010 and 2011.

Born in France, Ayew has been a full international for Ghana since 2008 and has earned 120 caps. At youth level, he starred for and captained the under-20 team that won both the 2009 African Youth Championship and the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He has played in three FIFA World Cups (2010, 2014 and 2022), as well as eight Africa Cup of Nations (2008, 2010, 2012, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023), helping them finish runners-up in 2010 and 2015, and was top goalscorer at the latter tournament.

On 7 August 2007, Ayew was called up for the first time by Ghana coach Claude Le Roy for the team's friendly match against Senegal on 21 August. He made his international debut in the match, appearing as a late-match substitute. On 11 January 2008, Ayew was named to the Ghana squad to play in the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations.

Ayew made his second major international tournament appearance by appearing at the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations. On 19 January 2010, in the team's final group stage match against Burkina Faso, he scored his first international goal in 30th minute with a header. Ghana won the match 1–0 and reached the final where they were defeated 1–0 by Egypt. Ayew appeared in all five matches the team contested.

On 7 May 2010, Ayew was named to coach Milovan Rajevac's 30-man preliminary squad to participate in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. He was later named to the 23-man team to compete in the competition alongside his brother Ibrahim. On 12 June, Ayew made his FIFA World Cup debut in the team's opening group stage match against Serbia, starting ahead of the more experienced Sulley Muntari. He later started in the team's ensuing group stage matches against Australia and Germany. In the team's round of 16 match against the United States, Ayew assisted on the game-winning goal scored by Asamoah Gyan after sending a lob–pass into the United States defense, which Gyan collected and then converted. For his performance in the match, Ayew was named Man of the Match by FIFA. Ayew missed the team's quarter-final defeat on penalties to Uruguay due to yellow card accumulation. He went on to play in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, scoring against Mali and Tunisia, as the Black Stars finished in fourth place.

In February 2013, Ayew retired from international football after a dispute with the Ghana Football Association. However, he returned to the team for a World Cup qualifier against Zambia on 6 September. He then went on to start in both legs of Ghana's 7–3 aggregate play-off defeat of Egypt to secure qualification to the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

On 2 June 2014, Ayew was named in Ghana's squad for the World Cup. In the team's opening match, he scored an 82nd minute equalising goal against the United States in an eventual 2–1 defeat. He then scored the Black Stars' first goal in a 2–2 draw with Germany in their second group match.

On 19 January 2015, Ayew scored Ghana's first goal of the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations in a 2–1 loss to Senegal.

Ayew is currently the captain of the Black Stars. On 3 January 2022, Ayew was named in Ghana's 28-man final squad for the delayed 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Ghana lost their first match at the tournament against Morocco, which Ayew played the full 90 minutes. He would however score a goal in Ghana's second group game, a 1–1 draw against Gabon. In Ghana's third game Ayew was sent off during the course of an unexpected 3–2 defeat to the Comoros, with Ghana finishing bottom of their group of four.

Ayew helped Ghana qualify for the 2022 World Cup, where they were placed in Group H. His participation at the tournament made Ayew the only Ghanaian player to feature at the nation's last three World Cups. In Ghana's first game of the group stage, Ayew scored his side's first goal of the competition, equalizing in the 73rd minute to bring the score to 1–1 during the course of an eventual 3–2 defeat against Portugal. Following a 3–2 victory over South Korea, Ghana required a win or draw in their final group match against Uruguay to advance, and were awarded an early penalty, taken by Ayew. However, Ayew would see his attempt saved, and Uruguay went on to score twice in the first half. At half-time, Ayew and his brother Jordan were both substituted, but the scoreline finished unchanged at 2–0, to send Ghana home in fourth place in their group.

Ayew was born in Seclin, a commune in the arrondissement of Lille, to Ghanaian parents. He holds both French and Ghanaian nationalities. His maternal grandfather Alhaji A.A. Khadir, is Lebanese. Ayew comes from a family of footballers. His father, Abedi Pele, was a professional footballer and was playing for Lille at the time of his birth. He is the nephew of Kwame Ayew and Sola Ayew, both of whom are former international footballers. Ayew also has two brothers who are professional footballers; Ibrahim and Jordan, and a sister, Imani. Jordan currently plays for Crystal Palace and Ibrahim currently plays for Lincoln Red Imps F.C. in Gibraltar.

Desmas came through the youth system at his hometown club Stade Brestois but failed to break into the first team and joined Chamois Niortais in the summer of 2015. He made his professional debut in November 2016 in a Coupe de France match against Stade Montois, and made his first league appearance later the same season.

Career
Born in Brest in north-west France, Desmas played junior football for Ploumoguer before joining the youth setup at Stade Brestois at the age of 11. Initially an outfield player, he transitioned to playing in goal due to his above-average height. During his ten years at Brest, he represented France at under-17 level, and went on to play several matches in the Championnat de France Amateur 2 (CFA2) for the club's reserve team between 2012 and 2015.

At the end of the 2014–15 season, Desmas was offered a trial by Ligue 2 club Chamois Niortais, who were in search of a new goalkeeper following the departures of Rodolphe Roche and Lucas Bobe. The trial period was successful and Desmas signed a one-year professional contract with the club on 23 June 2015. During his first season at Niort, Desmas was third-choice goalkeeper behind Paul Delecroix and Saturnin Allagbé, and as such was restricted mainly to reserve-team action, making 17 appearances in the CFA2. He also made the first-team substitutes' bench on six occasions, and at the end of the season was offered a two-year contract extension.

Club career
Born in San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa, Ruiz de Galarreta joined Athletic Bilbao's youth system in 2003, aged 10. On 14 December 2011, while still considered a youth squad player, he made his debut with the first team, coming on as a substitute for Borja Ekiza in the 88th minute of a 4–2 away loss against Paris Saint-Germain F.C. in that season's UEFA Europa League; during his first year, however, he almost exclusively played with the reserves in Segunda División B.

Ruiz de Galarreta made his second appearance for the main squad on 2 August 2012, again in the Europa League but now against NK Slaven Belupo (27 minutes played, 3–1 home win). He played his first La Liga game on the 19th of the same month, replacing Gaizka Toquero at half-time of an eventual 3–5 home defeat to Real Betis.

During a match with the B side against Lleida Esportiu on 21 October 2012, Ruiz de Galarreta ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament on his left knee, being sidelined for the remainder of the campaign. For 2013–14 he was loaned to CD Mirandés of Segunda División, where in a home game against CD Numancia, on 27 October he suffered the same injury.

The following years, Ruiz de Galarreta played with Real Zaragoza and CD Leganés on loan, helping the latter club achieve a first-ever promotion to the top flight in 2016. He continued to compete in the second division subsequently, representing Numancia, FC Barcelona B and UD Las Palmas.

On 2 September 2019, Ruiz de Galarreta signed a four-year contract with RCD Mallorca in the top tier, though it was agreed he would remain on loan at Las Palmas for the upcoming season.

He is noted by sports journalists for his dribbling, speed, and goal-scoring ability.

Nicknamed ""La Joya"" (""The Jewel""), Dybala began his senior club career in 2011 playing for Instituto de Córdoba, before signing for Palermo in 2012, at age 18, where he won a Serie B title. In 2015, Dybala signed for Juventus and won five league titles and four Coppas Italia. He was also voted Serie A Most Valuable Player in the season where Juventus won its record 9th Serie A title in a row, and he was included in the Serie A Team of the Year four times, and ranks as Juventus' ninth-highest all-time goalscorer. In 2022, he joined Roma.

Dybala made his senior international debut for Argentina in 2015 at the age of 21, and has since earned over 30 caps, including appearing at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 2019 Copa América, and 2022 World Cup, winning the latter title.

Dybala was born in Laguna Larga, Córdoba, Argentina. His grandfather, Bolesław Dybała, was from the village of Kraśniów in Poland; he fled from his country of birth to Argentina during World War II. Some of his grandfather's family moved to Canada. Dybala's family also has partial Italian origins through his maternal great-grandmother, who was from the Province of Naples.

Due to his family heritage, Dybala was eligible to play for Poland and Italy, but expressly stated that he feels Argentine and had always dreamed of playing for Argentina. Dybala stated ""I feel 100 percent Argentinian, I wouldn't be happy in a national team that didn't feel like mine, to hear an anthem that isn't my own, in colours that don't belong to me"".

Dybala was called by the Argentina under-17 team to participate in the XVI Pan American Games, but ultimately did not take part in the competition. On 19 July 2012, he received his first call-up for the under-20 team, but declined the invitation.

On 22 September 2015, Dybala was called for the first time for the Argentina senior team by manager Gerardo Martino, but his first appearance was on 13 October 2015, coming off the bench to replace Carlos Tevez in the 75th minute during a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying match against Paraguay. In May 2016, he was omitted from Argentina's 23-man squad for the Copa América Centenario. Although Juventus insisted that they would not release Dybala for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he was included in Martino's 35-man preliminary under-23 squad for the tournament on 24 May; he was not included in the final squad for the tournament, however.

On 1 September 2016, Dybala was sent off in the first half of a 1–0 home win over Uruguay in a 2018 World Cup qualifier for a second bookable offence. On 13 June 2017, he set up a goal for Joaquín Correa in a 6–0 away friendly win over Singapore.

In May 2018, Dybala was named in Argentina's preliminary 35-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia; later that month, he was included in Jorge Sampaoli's final 23-man squad for the tournament. He made his World Cup debut in Argentina's second group match on 21 June, coming on as a second-half substitute for Enzo Pérez in the 68th minute of an eventual 3–0 defeat to Croatia. This was his only appearance in the tournament, as Argentina were eliminated in the round of 16 on 30 June, following a 4–3 defeat to France.

Later that year, he scored his first senior international goal on 20 November, in a 2–0 friendly home win over Mexico.

In May 2019, Dybala was included in Argentina manager Lionel Scaloni's preliminary 40-man squad for the 2019 Copa América. Later that month, he was included in the final 23-man squad for the tournament. In Argentina's final group match against Qatar on 23 June, Dybala assisted Agüero's goal in a 2–0 win after coming off the bench for Lautaro Martínez, which enabled them to advance to the knock-out stages of the competition. In the third-place match against Chile on 6 July, Dybala made his first start of the tournament, and scored Argentina's second goal in an eventual 2–1 win, to help his team capture the bronze medal.

On 1 June 2022, Dybala scored Argentina's final goal in a 3–0 win over reigning European Champions Italy at Wembley Stadium in the 2022 Finalissima.

He was included in the final 26-man squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup by Lionel Scaloni. On 13 December, he made his first appearance against Croatia, replacing Julián Álvarez, in a 3–0 semi-final victory. Five days later, in the final, he substituted Nicolás Tagliafico right before the penalty shoot-out as the match ended 3–3 at extra-time. He made a late defensive clearance in his team's defensive area, and scored the second penalty in the shoot-out as his team eventually defeated France 4–2 to win the World Cup.

In May 2024, Dybala was left out of Scaloni's squad for the 2024 Copa América.

Dybala obtained Italian citizenship on 13 August 2012, in order to facilitate his move to Palermo, and circumvent FIGC regulations that permit only a maximum of two non-EU players in any Serie A team. Dybala initially attempted to obtain Polish citizenship through ancestry from his grandfather, but the bureaucracy proved too complex.

After five years in Italy, he signed with Sporting CP in 2017, where he was named club captain. He won back-to-back Taças da Liga in 2018 and 2019, as well as the Taça de Portugal, leading to him being named Primeira Liga Player of the Year in both seasons. In 2018–19, he scored a record of 33 goals in all competitions, making him the highest-scoring Portuguese midfielder and the highest-scoring midfielder in Europe in a single season. Fernandes' performances sparked the interest of several Premier League clubs, with Manchester United signing him for an initial €55 million (£47 million) in January 2020, becoming the second-highest fee for a Portuguese player leaving the domestic league.

Fernandes made his senior debut for Portugal in November 2017, after previously being capped at under-19, under-20 and under-21 levels. He also represented Portugal at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

He later had spells on loan with Spanish side Valencia, and French side Paris Saint-Germain, winning the Trophée des Champions and the Coupe de France with the latter club during the 2020–21 season.

On 14 November 2012, Florenzi made his debut for the senior team under coach Cesare Prandelli in a friendly match against France.

Florenzi was part of the Italy under-21 squad for the 2013 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Israel, as the Azzurrini reached the final, losing to Spain 4–2. Florenzi's only goal of the tournament came in the 4–0, group stage, victory over the host nation.

On 15 October 2013, Florenzi scored his first senior goal on his competitive debut in a World Cup qualifying match against Armenia that ended in a 2–2 draw at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.

On 30 August 2014, new Italy head coach Antonio Conte named Florenzi in his first squad for the upcoming European qualifying matches. On 31 May 2016, he was named to Conte's 23-man Italy squad for UEFA Euro 2016.

In June 2021, he was included in Italy's squad for UEFA Euro 2020 by manager Roberto Mancini.

Gamboa is an international player for Costa Rica and played in the team at the 2014 FIFA World Cup that reached the quarter-finals.

Club career
When 15 years of age, Gamboa was deemed not good enough to play for Costa Rican giants Saprissa and Alajuelense. He played from the 2006–2007 season for hometown club Municipal Liberia. He then moved abroad and joined Norwegian side Fredrikstad in summer 2010 and played there for two half seasons, before he joined Copenhagen in summer 2011. He made his debut in a 0–1 loss against Standard Liege in the UEFA Europa League.

Gamboa joined Rosenborg on a three-month-loan deal in August 2012 with the Norwegian club having an option to buy. He made his debut on 3 September 2012 in a Tippeligaen match away at Stabæk, winning 2–0. By November he had impressed sufficiently in the ten games he played in for Rosenborg for them to offer him a permanent deal, and he signed five-year contract with the club.

In late July 2014, English Premier League club West Bromwich Albion agreed to sign Gamboa for a fee estimated in the media as around £2 million. Because the player had insufficient recent international appearances for a work permit to be granted automatically, completion of the deal was dependent on a successful appeal to the Football Association, which was confirmed on 5 August. The player signed a three-year contract.

He made his debut on 26 August 2014, coming on as a second-half substitute in a League cup tie against Oxford United. He made his League debut a few days later against Swansea City, after which further substitute appearances followed. Gamboa finally made a starting appearance on 4 October in a 2–1 loss away at Liverpool in the league. Despite the defeat, he was reported as having turned in an impressive performance. It was however to be Gamboa's only league start that season, and he fell further out of favour when manager Alan Irvine was sacked in December and replaced by Tony Pulis. From January 2015 onwards to the end of the season, Gamboa only played one minute of first team football, coming on as an injury-time substitute in a fifth round FA Cup tie against West Ham in February 2015.

Gamboa continued to struggle to hold down a first team place in his second season in England, playing only two games early on in the season. He then went five months without a first team appearance, before making a return to the side in February 2016 in an FA Cup fourth round replay tie against Peterborough United.

On 30 August 2016, Gamboa signed for Scottish Premiership club Celtic on a three-year deal.

International career
He participated in the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup for Costa Rica where they finished in fourth place. He has represented Costa Rica in other international games.

He made his debut for the Costa Rica national football team in January 2010, in a friendly match against Argentina. Gamboa scored his first goal in a 7–0 home win against Guyana in a 2014 World Cup qualifier. He was selected for the Costa Rica squad that took part at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and played in all five games, reaching the quarter final where they eventually knocked out on penalty kicks by the Netherlands.",,1.73 m (5 ft 8 in),Costa Rica,Cristian Gamboa,Defender,Bochum,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/rgd53o1513015794.jpg,,152 lbs,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q577471,,,,,,,,,

In the 2017–18 and 2018–19, he was called up to the senior squad on several occasions, including the 2019 Coppa Italia Final, but did not make any appearances.

On 1 November 2021, Colpani scored his first goal of the 2021–22 season, helping Monza beat Alessandria 1–0.

Club career
Cherkaskyi Dnipro
Born in Cherkasy, Ukraine, Dovbyk is a product of the FC Cherkaskyi Dnipro academy after graduating from the Olympic Reserve Specialized Sports School Slavutych in Cherkasy. His professional debut Dovbyk made with his home team in 2014. He won the 2014–15 Ukrainian Second League, scoring 7 goals.

Dnipro
In summer 2015, he signed a contract with FC Dnipro, but in April 2016, he was then sent on a three-month loan to Moldovan club FC Zaria Bălți, where he won the Moldovan Cup. He would go on to score a joint team high 6 goals as he won the 2016–17 Ukrainian Premier League Best Young Player award. This prompted Ukraine national team coach Andriy Shevchenko to call him up for 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.

Midtjylland
When Dnipro were relegated due to incurring debt, Dovbyk stayed with the club. He would go on to score 12 goals in 13 games in the Ukrainian Second League, gaining interest from foreign clubs, and in 2018 he joined Danish club FC Midtjylland on a free transfer. In 2018 with FC Midtjylland Dovbyk became a national champion and in 2019 becoming a national cup holder. On 2 September 2019, he was loaned out to SønderjyskE for the 2019–20 season. With SønderjyskE, Dovbyk for the second time became a Danish cup holder.

Dnipro-1
After a lack of regular playing time and dry run-on scoresheet, in 2020 Dovbyk returned to Ukraine signing with the recently established SC Dnipro-1 that was just promoted to the Ukrainian premiers in previous season. While his league performance was somewhat under par from what expected, Dovbyk made a nice score run in the Ukrainian Cup netting 4 goals in three games, becoming one of the three top scorers in the tournament.

In 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine had started, the 2021–22 season was cancelled. Dovbyk made a temporary move to Dynamo Kyiv who were playing charity matches in Europe for the rest of the season to stay in form.

Girona
On 6 August 2023, Dovbyk signed for Spanish club Girona by signing a contract until 2028, for a reported fee of €7m, to be the most expensive player in club's history.

Born in Italy and a former youth international for Italy, he plays for the Australian national team.

Circati was born in Fidenza, Italy, to Gianfranco Circati, who was a professional footballer. Born in the province of Parma and Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, his grandparents resided in Salsomaggiore Terme and orignated from the region. Circati moved to Perth, Australia at the age of one. As a youth during school, Circati played football and rugby league, although focussed more on the former as he was ""okay"" at rugby. He attended Servite College during high school and idolised Paolo Maldini. Circati began his football career at Perth SC until the age of 14 when he moved to the academy system of Perth Glory.

Circati, being of dual Australian and Italian nationality, received offers from both countries to represent them in international football. In March 2022, Circati was selected by Italy U20 for two friendly matches against Germany and Norway. On 28 March, he made his debut against Norway as a starter and helped keep a clean sheet in a 5–0 win for the Azzurri. In September 2022, he was called up to the Italy U21 alongside Australian-born player Cristian Volpato. He was an unused substitute in the friendly against Japan on 26 September 2022.

On 6 June 2023, after talks with Graham Arnold and a phone call with his family, Circati made the decision to represent Australia rather than Italy, rejecting the Gli Azzurrini call-up to their youth team. He was added to the 23-man squad set to play against Argentina in Beijing, and was settled into the squad by Mathew Ryan. However, Circati was an unused substitute in two friendlies with the Socceroos, sitting on the bench in the matches against Argentina and Mexico (on 12 September).

Circati made his debut on 18 October 2023 in a friendly match against New Zealand at Brentford Community Stadium. He played a part in the opening goal scored by Harry Souttar and kept a clean sheet in the process as Australia won 2–0 over their rivals.

Club career
Early career
With his club having already advanced to the knockout stage of the Europa League, the 17-year old da Costa made his Leverkusen debut as a second-half substitute against Atlético Madrid, coming on for Gonzalo Castro. da Costa made his Bundesliga debut on 24 September 2011, facing off against Bayern Munich and the manager who gave him his debut, Jupp Heynckes. da Costa would go on to make 6 appearances in the Bundesliga, as well as one in the Champions League, coming against Barcelona in the first round of the knockout stage.

FC Ingolstadt
In the offseason, da Costa secured a move to 2. Bundesliga side FC Ingolstadt, initially on a two-year loan. da Costa made his club debut on 3 August 2012 against Energie Cottbus, and started the first two games of the season at right-back before being supplanted by Andreas Görlitz. da Costa made his return on match day 7, coming on as a substitute against 1860 Munich. This led to a run of 13 consecutive starts for die Schanzer, and da Costa finished the season having started 26 of their 34 games with his club finishing in the middle of the table. da Costa also made 26 starts in the 2013–14 season.

On 31 October 2014, in a match between the table leaders at the time, Ingolstadt and Fortuna Düsseldorf, da Costa suffered a leg injury in a collision with Lukas Schmitz, and had to be stretchered off. The injury was severe − a fractured tibia − and put his career in jeopardy. da Costa made his competitive return in the DFB-Pokal against Unterhaching on 9 August 2015 in advance of Ingolstadt's first ever season in the Bundesliga. da Costa appeared in the Bundesliga for the first time with Ingolstadt on 25 September, coming on as a late substitute in the 1–1 draw. He would make two more substitute appearances before earning his first start in the final match of the Hinrunde, a 1–0 loss to former club Bayer Leverkusen. da Costa started all but one match in the second half, as Ingolstadt survived their first season in 10th position. With three matches left in the season, football magazine kicker reported that Leverkusen would be exercising a buy back option on da Costa. The news came days after the club announced that manager Ralph Hasenhüttl would not be returning, with Hasenhüttl eventually moving on to newly promoted side RB Leipzig.

Return to Leverkusen
On 2 May 2016, da Costa officially returned to former club Bayer Leverkusen, with the move becoming effective 1 July. da Costa was in and out of the squad during his lone season back with die Werkself, making just three appearances in the Bundesliga. His lone start came against former club Ingolstadt, but he was substituted off at the half in favor of Wendell. da Costa also made one appearance in Leverkusen's Champions League campaign, coming in the final day of the group stage against AS Monaco. He was one of seven changes from Leverkusen's previous Champions League tie, as they had already advanced to the knockout stage.

Eintracht Frankfurt
At the end of the 2016-17 season, da Costa signed for Eintracht Frankfurt. da Costa sustained an injury in training prior to the fourth match day, a partial tendon tear which caused him to miss around three months of the season. He made his return in their 2–1 cup victory over Heidenheim, coming on in extra time to provide the assist on Sébastien Haller's winner. Initially behind Timothy Chandler on the depth chart at right back, da Costa played his way into manager Niko Kovač's plans as he started the final 13 games of the season. Kovač lined da Costa up on the right and Chandler on the left, with fellow right-back contender Marius Wolf in the midfield. On 3 March, da Costa scored his first senior goal, the only goal in a victory over Hannover. da Costa featured in Eintracht's team that won the 2017–18 DFB-Pokal against Bayern Munich, playing the forward ball that found Ante Rebić for the winner. The trophy was the club's first since 1988.

da Costa began the 2018–19 season in good form, starting every match of the season at right-back under new manager Adi Hütter. Hütter sought to implement a pressing style, one da Costa was familiar with from his time at Leverkusen under Roger Schmidt. On 4 October, da Costa scored the first and final goals in Eintracht's 4–1 win over Italian side Lazio in the Europa League.

International career
Da Costa has represented Germany at U17 making 11 appearances, U18 making six appearances and currently six appearances at U19 level.

In July 2014 he was asked to switch his international allegiance to Angola.

After missing the 2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship due to injury, da Costa was included in the provisional squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

Having begun his career at Independiente Medellín, Cuadrado moved to Italy in 2009 to join Udinese. Used sparingly at the club, he was loaned to Lecce for the 2011–12 season, where despite relegation from Serie A, his performances earned a transfer to Fiorentina.

After being made Atlético's first-choice goalkeeper, he helped the team win the UEFA Europa League and the UEFA Super Cup in 2010. His performances subsequently attracted the attention of Manchester United, and De Gea joined the club in 2011 for £18.9 million, a British record for a goalkeeper at the time.

During his time at Manchester United, De Gea made over 500 appearances and won a Premier League title, an FA Cup, two League Cups, three Community Shields and the UEFA Europa League. For three consecutive seasons from 2013–14 to 2015–16, he was elected as United's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year, the first player in the award's history to win on three successive occasions (four in total), as well as being included in four consecutive (five in total) PFA Team of the Year sides from 2015 to 2018. In 2018, he was named in the FIFA FIFPro World11. De Gea left United as following the expiration of his contract in 2023, and, following a year away from football, joined Fiorentina.

Tipped by many as the successor to Iker Casillas as Spain's long-term goalkeeper, De Gea was the captain for the Spain under-21 national team that won the European Championship in 2011 and 2013, and also competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics. He made his debut for the senior team in 2014 and was selected for that year's World Cup.

Born in London, Bynoe-Gittens started his career with local side Caversham Trents at the age of five, and stayed until he was seven. Shortly after, he joined Reading, and also spent some time with Chelsea. At under-9 level, he chose to remain with Reading, and stayed there until under-14 level, when he chose to sign with Manchester City.

Borussia Dortmund
After two years in Manchester, Bynoe-Gittens moved to Germany in 2020 to sign for Borussia Dortmund. His career in Dortmund was hampered by not only the COVID-19 pandemic, but a torn ligament injury that kept him out for a number of months. However, the 2021–22 season was a much better one for Bynoe-Gittens; notable performances in the UEFA Youth League, where he scored six goals in four games, including two against Manchester United, earned him a call-up to Marco Rose's first team squad.

Bynoe-Gittens made his Bundesliga debut in a 6–1 win over VfL Wolfsburg on 16 April 2022.

2022–23 season

He spent three seasons with the club where he won a further three league titles, two DFB-Pokal trophies and a winners' medal in each of the FIFA Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup. He then returned to Dortmund in 2016, where he added another DFB-Pokal title and a DFL-Supercup to his name.

Götze was first selected for the Germany national football team in 2010, at the age of 18. He was included in the squad for UEFA Euro 2012 and, two years later, scored the winning goal in the 2014 FIFA World Cup final.

Having begun his career in the academies of West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur, Forson joined Manchester United in January 2019.

The same year, he was promoted to the under-18 side at the age of sixteen, and in August 2021, he signed his first professional deal with the club.

Ahead of the 2023–24 season, Forson was included in Manchester United's senior squad for pre-season, travelling to Oslo, Norway, where he featured in a 2–0 friendly win against Leeds United. Playing the entire first half at left-wing, Forson was noted for his ability to take on players, and was labelled a ""constant threat"". He was included in Manchester United's tour of the United States, and having been named in the starting line-up for the friendly game against German side Borussia Dortmund, he was taken off by manager Erik ten Hag after only thirty-seven minutes, following a confrontation with Dortmund winger, Karim Adeyemi, for which both received yellow cards. Following the game, ten Hag explained that if the game had featured VAR, Forson may have been sent off, and that he had spent time explaining his decision to the player following the substitution.

Club career
Early career
Born in Tuse outside Holbæk, Frendrup started playing for local team Tuse IF, before moving to Holbæk B&I. He was only at Holbæk for one year, because he had joined the Brøndby IF academy at under-14 level, which meant that he played for two clubs for a short period. During this time, he commuted several times a week between his home in Tuse and Brøndby, a distance of approximately 60 kilometres. When Frendrup finished primary education, he began attending Brøndby Idrætsefterskole, a five minute walk from the Brøndby IF training ground.

He won the Danish under-15 Cup on 11 May 2016 in a 1–0 win over FC Nordsjælland. At under-17 level, he captained the team to a second-place finish in the league behind winners AGF.

Brøndby
In the summer of 2017, aged 16, Frendrup was included in the first-team training camp in Austria together with fellow academy players Christian Enemark and Andreas Bruus. In December 2017, he signed a new deal with Brøndby, keeping him in the club until the summer of 2020.

On 11 February 2018, Frendrup made his senior debut, aged 16, in a 3–1 win over Lyngby Boldklub in the Danish Superliga. He was brought on as a substitute in the 85th minute, becoming the youngest player to appear for Brøndby, 37 days younger than second on the list, Magnus Warming. On 15 March 2018, Frendrup signed his first professional contract, keeping him at the club until 2021.

During the 2019–20 season, Frendrup started playing more regularly in the fall due to long-term injuries to starters Lasse Vigen, Simon Tibbling and Josip Radošević. His performances during these games were praised, and he subsequently won the Brøndby Player of the Month award for November. On 12 January 2020, Frendrup signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with Brøndby, running until 2023. He continued his strong performances in the second half of the season and was named Superliga Talent of the Month for June 2020, as well as Brøndby Player of the Month for June and July.",,1.78 m (5 ft 10 in),Denmark,Morten Wetche Frendrup,Midfielder,Genoa,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/lcmssc1610626477.jpg,,63 kg,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q52158000,http://www.instagram.com/mortenfrendrup/,Right,,,,,,,

Having previously called up to the Japan's youth team for the rest of 2015, Yamada was called up to the U21 squad the following year. He went on to make two appearances for the U21 side.

In March 2016, Kamada was called up to the Japan U23 squad for the first time. He made his Japan U23 debut, coming on as a 65th-minute substitute, in a 2–1 win against Mexico U23 on 25 March 2016. Kamada made his first starts for the Japan U23 side, and played 64 minutes before being substituted, in a 2–1 win against Guinea U23 on 25 May 2016. Kamada went on to make four appearances for Japan U23, with two other matches he featured were substitute.

Having previously failed to make a cut to the Samurai Blue squad for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, it was announced on 15 March 2019 that Kamada was called up to the Japan squad for the first time. He made his debut for the Samurai Blue on 22 March 2019 in a friendly against Colombia, as a 79th-minute substitute for Takumi Minamino. Kamada then scored his first Japan goal, in a 6–0 win against Mongolia on 10 October 2019. Almost a year later, in October 2020, he was called up to the Samurai Blue squad. Kamada then scored three goals in three matches for Japan between 25 March 2021 and 28 May 2021 against South Korea, Mongolia and Myanmar.

Kamada's father, Fukushige, was once a footballer and worked for the seniors and juniors at Osaka University of Physical Education. Because of his father's guidance, Kamada worked hard and learned how to use his body, enabling him to go back and forth between the attacking third and middle thirds, and his number of pass variations increased. He has a younger brother, Hiromu Kamada, who is also a footballer. In his free time, Kamada has said he is learning German and reads manga. Kamada credited teammate Makoto Hasebe for helping settle down in Germany.

At one point, Kamada considered going to university, saying: ""Going to college may be a necessary path for me, but I still have a feeling that I can't give up. If I become a professional after graduating from college, I'm already 22 years old. However, I thought it would be very late to become a professional at the age of 22. For me, it is ideal that I go to the J League from high school and start from the first year, and I think I should do that. And I'm thinking about the future of the J League. I've always had a dream to go out into the world and play. I don't appreciate it, but I have enough confidence to do it."" Growing up, Kamada said he wanted to be a footballer. On 25 May 2017, Kamada announced his marriage, to a woman he had been dating for a long time. A year later in October 2018, he became a first time father when his wife gave birth to a baby boy. Since moving to Eintracht Frankfurt, Kamada resides in the city with his family.",,184 cm,Japan,Daichi Kamada,Midfielder,Crystal Palace,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/ohn3yf1578087082.jpg,,168 lbs,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q20039495,www.instagram.com/kamadadaichi/,,,,,,,,

Club career
Millwall
King signed a one-year contract with Millwall in August 2014, having left the Crystal Palace youth team earlier in the season.

He joined National League club Welling United on an initial one-month youth loan on 24 July 2015. He went on to make 20 appearances for the ""Wings"", before he was recalled by Millwall on 21 December.

King returned to the National League on 19 February 2016, joining Braintree Town for an initial 28-day emergency loan. In his second appearance for the club, against Guiseley at Nethermoor Park, King became involved in a controversial incident during an 1–1 draw. He conceded the equalising goal after Oliver Norburn broke a fair play protocol and lobbed him from 30-yards out rather than passing the ball to him, after Braintree had kicked the ball into touch to allow an injured Braintree player to receive treatment; a five-minute fracas followed but the goal was allowed to stand after security staff separated the players and management, and Guiseley manager Mark Bower refused to allow Braintree to walk through and score. Bower went on to say: ""Their keeper stood there with his arms in the air and allowed the ball to into the net. It put us in a really difficult position whether we should allow them to score or not but we decided no. I think their keeper was trying to be clever and had simply let the ball go in."" King said he was ""bewildered"" by Bower's statement, and speaking on the incident itself said that: ""It is one of those things that will be remembered for a long time, I'll be remembered for a long time and it will carry on forever"". The incident was described as ""one of the biggest on-field controversies seen in non-league football"", and Braintree manager Danny Cowley said that: ""it's the worst thing I've seen on a football pitch and it was disgraceful unsporting behaviour on their part"". The following week, Guiseley chairman Phil Rogerson released a statement recognising the fair-play convention had not been followed: ""... myself, Mark  and the club find the situation most regrettable and not in line with the general ethos of Guiseley AFC. Fair play is and always has been at the heart of the club. The decision to continue playing as normal after the goal was taken on the spur of the moment and under extreme pressure, not helped at all by the heated atmosphere."" King went on to extend his loan at Cressing Road until the end of the 2015–16 season, and Braintree qualified for the play-offs, losing out to Grimsby Town at the semi-final stage following a 2–1 aggregate defeat.",,6 ft 4 in,Wales,Tom King,Goalkeeper,Everton,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/hbxydr1507729568.jpg,,174 lbs,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q27139397,,,0.0,0.0,,0.0,,0.0,0.0

Lukaku began his senior club career playing for Anderlecht, where he won a Belgian Pro League title and finished as the league's top goalscorer. In 2011, he joined Chelsea in a transfer worth £10 million (€12 million), but limited playing time resulted in loans to West Bromwich Albion and Everton; in 2014, Lukaku signed with Everton in a then club-record transfer worth £28 million (€32 million), going on to finish as the league's second-top goalscorer. He subsequently signed with Manchester United in a transfer worth £75 million (€88 million), but after a breakdown in relations with the club, Lukaku departed for Inter Milan in 2019, in a club-record deal worth €80 million (£68.1 million), where he won a Serie A title and the Serie A Most Valuable Player award.

In 2021, Lukaku returned to Chelsea in a club-record transfer worth £97.5 million (€115 million), becoming the seventh-most expensive player, the most expensive Belgian player and, at the time, the most expensive player of all time in cumulative transfer fees. However, after one season, he was sent out on loan back to Italy to Inter Milan and Roma before joining another Italian club Napoli on a permanent deal.

Early life
Christian Gytkjær started his youth career playing for Roskilde, before moving on to Lyngby in 2005. In October 2007, he was invited for a trial at Liverpool in England with his brother, Frederik, ultimately nothing materialized from the visit. Gytkjær went on to be Lyngby's top scorer in 2007–08 for the under-18 side.

Club career
Lyngby Boldklub
Gytkjær was called up to the Lyngby first team in the middle of 2008, signing a new contract keeping him at the club until 2010. He scored three goals in eight appearances in his debut season in the 1st Division. By the 2009–10 campaign, Gytkjær had become one of Lyngby's most anticipated talents to come through their youth system.

On 2 February 2010, it was confirmed Gytkjær would leave Lyngby when his contract expired in the summer to join Danish Cup winners Nordsjælland on a free transfer, signing a three-year contract, following in the footsteps of Andreas Bjelland, Andreas Laudrup and Morten Nordstrand, who had left Lyngby for the Farum-based club. While his future had been set, Gytkjær was still to play out the remainder of the 2009–10 season with Lyngby, where he was targeted by the supporters who disapproved in seeing another player their team had nurtured head over to neighboring rivals. The backlash was only increased when the player was photographed with an FCN shirt while still under contract to Lyngby.

Nordsjælland
Christian Gytkjær made his debut for Nordsjælland in a 2–0 away defeat to Superliga champions Copenhagen on 14 August 2010, when he was brought into the team to replace Nicki Bille Nielsen, who was sold to Villarreal.

Lech Poznań
On 28 June 2017, he signed a two-year contract with Ekstraklasa side Lech Poznań, with the option for an extra 12 months.

He made his debut for the club during the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League second qualifying round away game against FK Haugesund, which Lech lost 3–2. He scored his first (and second) goal for Lech in a 5–1 home win over Piast Gliwice in the third round of the 2017–18 season.

On 7 March 2019, he signed a contract extension, running until the end of the 2019–20 season.

On 19 July 2020, during his last game for Lech, he scored twice in a 4–0 home win against Jagiellonia Białystok and led the team to secure second place in the 2019–20 season. He finished the campaign as top scorer with 24 goals. He also won Forward of the Season award. During the three years at Lech Poznań, he played in 119 games and scored 65 goals, which made him the best foreign goalscorer in club's history.

Monza
On 22 July 2020, Gytkjær joined newly-promoted Italian Serie B side Monza on a free transfer, signing a two-year contract with the option of a third. He made his debut on 3 October against Empoli, and scored his first goal on 31 October, converting a penalty kick against Cittadella. He renewed his expiring contract in February 2022 for one year.

With five goals in four 2021–22 Serie B promotion play-off games – including three goals in two final games against Pisa – Gytkjær helped Monza gain promotion to the Serie A for the first time in their history, and was awarded the play-off MVP award. He made his Serie A debut on 13 August 2022, as a substitute in a 2–1 home defeat to Torino. On 18 September, Gytkjær came on as a substitute and scored in an upset 1–0 win against Italian giants Juventus; it was Monza's first-ever Serie A win.

International career
Gytkjær was part of the Denmark under-17 team that won the 2006 Nordic Championship in the Faroe Islands. He scored three goals in a 4–0 win over England in the final.

Career
Le Havre AC
An academy product of French top division side Le Havre, Hanin started his senior career there in 2008. He was unable to break into the first team, and spent three years playing for the reserve team in the French amateur division.

Leixões S.C.
Hanin signed on a free transfer for Portuguese Segunda Liga club Leixões S.C. on 18 May 2011. He was a regular starter for the club in the 2011–12 season, and stated in 2015 that this was his turning point for his professional career.

S.C. Braga
After his contract with Leixões expired, he was signed by Primeira Liga club S.C. Braga on 1 July 2012. However, he became the third choice for left back, and never played for the first team. He spent the first half season playing regularly for the reserve squad in Segunda Liga, before being sent on loan to fellow Primeira Liga club Moreirense F.C. on 15 January 2013. He played for the latter club for the rest of the 2012–13 season, but was unable to keep them from getting relegated. He had another loan spell at the club in the next season, but the loan was terminated on 1 January 2014. He was signed on a six-month loan by Greek Superleague Panetolikos F.C. on 17 January 2014, and featured frequently for the club.

Lierse S.K.
On 1 July 2014, Hanin was signed by Belgian Pro League club Lierse S.K. on a permanent deal. Hanin describes this as «A very bad experience. It showed me the bad side of football, the worst period I've experienced.» After an initially good period, the team lost three matches and the coach was fired. Due to a conflict between the sporting director and the club president, a new coach with a radically different playing style was brought in. As Hanin struggled with the long-ball type of play, he did not play under the new coach. He was released by the club in the winter transfer window, having only played 9 matches for the club.

Strømsgodset Toppfotball
Hanin was signed on a one-year contract by Norwegian Tippeliga club Strømsgodset Toppfotball on 23 March 2015, becoming the only signing for the club before the 2015 season. The club commented that they had studied the French player thoroughly with the analysis program InStat Football, and described the player as an «offensive, quick and skilled left back».

Hanin told French football magazine So Foot that the Norwegian club originally wanted to sign him for two years, but due to a groin problem, the contract was set to one year, with a possible 2-3 year extension.

He is regarded as one of the best strikers of all time, as well as one of the most successful players in Bundesliga and Bayern Munich history. He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.

After being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszków, Lewandowski moved to top-flight Lech Poznań, helping the team win the 2009–10 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league's top goalscorer award. In 2013, he also featured with Dortmund in the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final. Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019–20 as part of a treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer. He was widely considered the best player of 2020 and deserving of the Ballon d'Or, until it was canceled. In 2022, he was signed by Barcelona, where he won the Supercopa de España, the La Liga title and the Pichichi Trophy in his debut season.

A full international for Poland since 2008, Lewandowski has earned 145 caps and was a member of their team at the UEFA European Championship in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022. With 82 international goals, Lewandowski is the all-time top scorer for Poland and the third overall men's international goalscorer in Europe, only behind Ferenc Puskás (84) and Cristiano Ronaldo (123). He won IFFHS World's Best International Goal Scorer Award in 2015 and 2021, IFFHS World's Best Top Goal Scorer Award in 2020 and 2021, and IFFHS World's Best Top Division Goal Scorer Award in 2021. He also won the IFFHS World's Best Player in 2020 and 2021 and the European Golden Shoe for the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons. Lewandowski has been named the Polish Footballer of the Year a record eleven times and the Polish Sports Personality of the Year three times. Moreover, he has won the Gerd Müller Trophy twice, in 2021 and 2022.

In 2020, Lewandowski won the Best FIFA Men's Player Award (retained in 2021) and the UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award. He has been named to the UEFA Team of the Year twice. He is the third-highest goalscorer in the history of the Champions League. Lewandowski has been named the VDV Bundesliga Player of the Season a record five times. He has scored over 300 goals in the Bundesliga (second-highest goalscorer of all time in Bundesliga, only behind Gerd Müller's 365 Bundesliga goals), having reached the century mark quicker than any other foreign player, and is the league's all-time leading foreign goalscorer. In 2015, while playing for Bayern, he scored five goals in less than nine minutes against VfL Wolfsburg, the fastest by any player in Bundesliga history as well as any major European football league for which he was awarded four Guinness World Records. Moreover, he has won the Bundesliga Top Scorer Award in seven seasons, most prominently in the 2020–21 Bundesliga where he scored 41 goals in a single campaign, breaking Gerd Müller's previous Bundesliga record of 40 goals, set in 1971–72. On 30 November 2021, he finished second in the Ballon d'Or, just 33 points behind the winner Lionel Messi.

Lewandowski's father gave him the name Robert to make it easier for him when moving abroad as a professional footballer. Lewandowski's father, Krzysztof (died in 2005), was a Polish judo champion, and also played football for Hutnik Warsaw in the second division. His mother, Iwona, is a former volleyball player for AZS Warsaw and later vice-president of Partyzant Leszno. His sister, Milena, also plays volleyball and has represented the U21 national team.

His wife, Anna Lewandowska, won the bronze medal at the 2009 Karate World Cup. They married on 22 June 2013 in the Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Serock. They have two daughters: Klara (born 2017) and Laura (born 2020).

Lewandowski is a practising Catholic. He met Pope Francis in October 2014, when Bayern Munich visited Vatican City following a 7–1 win over A.S. Roma in the UEFA Champions League.

In October 2017, the day after scoring to help Poland qualify for the 2018 World Cup, Lewandowski finished his Bachelor of Physical Education (BPhEd) with coaching and management at the Academy of Sport Education in Warsaw, concluding a decade of studies. In the same year, he bought a luxury apartment in Złota 44 in Warsaw.

Club career
Born in Zagreb, Croatia, Juranović went through the ranks of the third-tier NK Dubrava, apart from a two-month stint at the nearby NK Croatia Sesvete academy. Making his third-level senior debut in the 2012–13 season, he first drew attention to himself by winning the Croatian leg of the Nike Chance competition for amateur players in early 2014, earning the right to vie for a spot in the Nike Academy team. Not making the 5-person cut, however, he returned to his club. His club performances remained strong, and, touted by some media as the best player of the autumn leg of the 2014/2015 Treća HNL Zapad, he drew the attention of HNK Hajduk Split.

After signing a three and a half-year long contract with Hajduk in early 2015, he initially joined their third-tier B team, but was moved to the first team in April 2015 by the new manager Goran Vučević, and he made his Prva HNL debut in a 1–2 home loss against HNK Rijeka.

In June 2018, Juranović was selected in the Prva HNL team of the season for his performances in 2017-18.

International career
On 6 September 2019, Zlatko Dalić activated Juranović's standby call-up for Croatia's Euro 2020 qualifying matches against Slovakia and Azerbaijan, following Tin Jedvaj's injury.

Regarded as one of the best players in the world and of his generation, he is known for his dribbling, finishing, and speed.

Born in Paris and raised in nearby Bondy, Mbappé began his senior club career in 2015 with Monaco, where he won the Ligue 1 title in the 2016–17 season. In 2017, aged 18, Mbappé signed for Paris Saint-Germain on an eventual permanent transfer worth €180 million, making him the second-most-expensive player and most expensive teenage player of all time. With PSG, he won six Ligue 1 titles and four Coupes de France, including a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, while also leading the club to its first ever UEFA Champions League final in 2020.

He won the UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Intercontinental Cup in the first half of his debut season, scoring in both finals.

At the 2022 FIFA World Cup, France reached the final again; Mbappé won the Golden Boot and Silver Ball and set the record for the most goals scored in World Cup final matches by scoring a hat-trick. Mbappé is one of only two players to have scored in two consecutive World Cup finals (the other being Brazil's Vavá in 1958 and 1962).

McGinn previously played for St Mirren and Hibernian, and also represented Scotland at the under-19 and under-21 levels. He made his full international debut in March 2016.

Club career
St Mirren
McGinn started his career as a youth player at St Mirren playing for the club's Ralston Academy. He broke into the first team in pre-season of the 2012–13 season, representing the club against English opposition Carlisle United and Accrington Stanley. In the same summer he also helped the under-20 side to victory in Kilbirnie Ladeside pre-season tournament, picking up joint player of the tournament with Jack Smith. McGinn made his competitive début against SPL champions Celtic in a 5–0 defeat, coming off the bench as a 78th-minute substitute.

On 29 November 2012, McGinn signed a new three-year contract, keeping him at St Mirren Park until summer 2015. McGinn played the first 81 minutes of the 2013 Scottish League Cup Final, as St Mirren won the League Cup by winning 3–2 against Hearts.

In April 2015, McGinn was ""speared"" by St Mirren club captain Steven Thompson during a training session prank gone wrong. The resulting injury meant that McGinn missed the remainder of the season, and in turn took legal action against the club.

Hibernian
On 31 July 2015, McGinn joined Hibernian on a four-year contract. Hibs paid St Mirren a development fee and promised them 30% of any future transfer fee. McGinn was part of the Hibernian team that won the 2015–16 Scottish Cup, the club's first victory in the competition for 114 years. In the following season, McGinn helped Hibs win promotion to the Scottish Premiership.

Hibs rejected three offers from EFL Championship club Nottingham Forest for McGinn during August 2017. McGinn scored both of the Hibs goals in a 2–2 draw at Celtic on 30 September, and the first goal in a 2–1 win at Rangers on 3 February 2018. McGinn was one of four players nominated for the 2017–18 PFA Scotland Players' Player of the Year award.

Celtic made three offers for McGinn during July 2018, but these were all rejected by Hibernian. During this period of transfer speculation, McGinn continued to play regularly for Hibs and scored the winning goal in a Europa League qualifier against Asteras Tripolis. McGinn visited Aston Villa's training ground on 7 August to discuss a potential transfer, which was completed the following day.

Aston Villa
McGinn signed a four-year contract with Aston Villa on 8 August 2018. He made his debut for Villa in a 3–2 win against Wigan on 11 August, during which he provided an assist for the opening goal and his inswinging corner forced an own goal in the second half.

International career
McGinn received an international call-up when he was selected as part of a Scotland under-19 squad for a training camp in Turkey in January 2013. He later went on to make his international debut for the under-19 side against Netherlands in a 2–1 defeat. McGinn then captained the under-19s against Serbia in Stara Pazova. On 5 March 2014, he made his debut for the Scotland under-21 side in a 2–2 draw against Hungary at Tannadice. McGinn later captained the under-21 team.

McGinn received his first call-up to the senior Scotland squad in March 2016, for a friendly against Denmark. McGinn played for the whole of the 1–0 win and was awarded man of the match.

Personal life
John is the third of four children to parents Stephen and Mary. He has a twin sister, Katie, and his older brothers Stephen and Paul are also professional footballers. All three brothers have been with St Mirren at some stage in their careers.

Club career
Born in Monfalcone, the city his parents had moved to from Naples, Pafundi started his footballing career with his hometown club UFM Monfalcone, until he got noticed by Udinese scouts during a youth tournament in 2014, and was signed by the Serie A side soon thereafter.

Throughout the 2021–22 season, Pafundi emerged as a star player and a regular for the club's under-19 team, having scored six goals and provided seven assists in 16 games in the Campionato Primavera 2 at just sixteen years of age: around this period of time, he signed his first professional contract with Udinese and received his first call-ups to the club's first team.

On 22 May 2022, at 16 years old, Pafundi made his professional debut for Udinese, coming on as a substitute for Roberto Pereyra at the 68th minute of the team's final league game of the season, a 4–0 away win over Salernitana. In the same occasion, he became the first player born in 2006 to take part in a Serie A match.

International career
Youth
Pafundi represented Italy at several youth international levels, having played for the under-16 and under-17 national teams.

Senior
In May 2022, Pafundi was called-up by head coach Roberto Mancini to join a training camp with the Italy senior national team, as part of a stage reserved to the most promising players in the country.

In November of the same year, he received his first official call-up to the senior national team for two friendlies against Albania and Austria. He eventually made his debut with the Azzurri on 16 November 2022, at 16 years old, playing the final minutes against Albania, thus becoming the third-youngest debutant in the history of the Italian national team, and the youngest debutant ever in the last 100 years.

Style of play
A short, left-footed trequartista, Pafundi has been regarded mainly for his ball control, vision and pace, which allow him to be a frequent threat in the final third, both as an assist-man and as a finisher. He has been compared to former Udinese captain and striker Antonio Di Natale.

Personal life
Pafundi has an older brother, Andrea (b. 2004), who is also a footballer: they played alongside each other in the youth ranks of Udinese.",,"166cm / 5'5""",Italy,Simone Pafundi,Attacking Midfield,Sampdoria,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/pbc4ju1678458170.jpg,,139 lbs,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q112112959,,Left,,,,,,,

Palazón made his professional debut on 18 August 2019, starting in a 3–1 away loss against Cádiz CF. He scored his first goal in the category on 26 October, netting his team's second in a 3–1 away defeat of Rayo Vallecano

Ndidi was part of the Nigerian youth setup during his time at Nathaniel Boys of Lagos. While playing the African U-17 Championship with Nigeria, he was excluded along with two other players from the competition as a precaution, following an MRI age test that suggested he was just slightly above the threshold. Notwithstanding, he joined up with his teammates in the U-20 team the following year, forming the bedrock of the midfield. He was called up to the senior Nigeria national football team on 8 October 2015, making his debut in the friendly game against DR Congo, and playing again a few days later in the 3–0 win against Cameroon, when he replaced John Obi Mikel in the 63rd minute.

He was selected by Nigeria for their 35-man provisional squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics.

In May 2018 he was named in Nigeria’s preliminary 30-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. He was included in the African Cup of Nations 2019 squad and played in Nigeria's first match against Burundi. On 25 December 2021, Ndidi was selected in Nigeria's 2021 Africa Cup of Nations 28-man squad by Nigeria's caretaker coach Austin Eguavoen. On January 22, 2022, after the Africa Cup of Nations, Cameroon 2021 Group Stage, Confédération Africaine de Football (CAF) shortlisted Ndidi in the group stage's best team as a substitute alongside Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane.

Ndidi grew up in the barracks as his father was a serving Army officer before his retirement. Discipline and education were the priority there, while football was a passion his father frowned upon. “Any time my dad went to work I would go and play,” Ndidi said in an interview with BBC World Service.

In May 2019, Ndidi married his longtime girlfriend Dinma Fortune in Abuja.

Club career
Early years
Born in Hita, Ōita, Mitoma eventually moved to Kawasaki, Kanagawa in his earlier days, where he grew up in Miyamae-ku. He then joined the Kawasaki Frontale academy at the U10 level. He was then offered a promotion from the U-18s to the senior team coached by Yahiro Kazama, but instead chose to enroll at the University of Tsukuba and join its football club, known for being a powerhouse club at university level; some of its alumni include Shogo Taniguchi and Shintaro Kurumaya. Mitoma professed to feeling unprepared to enter professional football at age 18, citing the struggles of fellow Kawasaki academy products Ko Itakura and Koji Miyoshi to win regular playing time with the senior squad. He wrote his university thesis on dribbling.

During his time at Tsukuba, Mitoma was selected to represent Japan at the 2017 and 2019 Universiade tournaments, as well as the 2018 Asian Games and the 2019 Toulon Tournament with the under-23 national team. Playing in the Kanto University Soccer League  with Tsukuba, he was named to the all-league XI in his final three seasons while majoring in physical education.

A versatile player, Müller plays as a midfielder or forward, and has been deployed in a variety of attacking roles – as an attacking midfielder, second striker, centre forward and on either wing.

Müller has been praised for his positioning, teamwork and stamina, work-rate, and has shown consistency in both scoring and creating goals. He is also widely regarded as one of the best players to ever play without the ball due to his immaculate positional awareness. Due to numerous strengths in his game, he is also widely regarded as one of the most complete attacking players in the game.

A product of Bayern's youth system, he made his first-team breakthrough in the 2009–10 season after Louis van Gaal was appointed as the main coach; he played almost every game as the club won the league and cup double and reached the Champions League final. Müller scored 23 goals in the 2012–13 season as Bayern won a historic treble; the league title, cup and Champions League. He broke the Bundesliga record for assists by providing 21 in a season (a record in the top five leagues jointly held with Lionel Messi in La Liga) and scored 14 goals as Bayern won a second treble in the 2019–20 season.

Müller earned a call-up to the German national team in 2010. At the 2010 World Cup he scored five goals in six appearances as Germany finished in third place. He was named the Best Young Player of the tournament and won the Golden Boot as the tournament's top scorer, with five goals and three assists. At the 2014 World Cup he played a major role in helping the team win the trophy, scoring five goals and receiving the Silver Ball as the tournament's second top player and the Silver Boot as the second top goalscorer, and was also named in the World Cup All Star XI and in the Dream Team. In 2014, Müller was ranked the fifth-best footballer in the world by The Guardian.",http://www.facebook.com/es.muellert,"185cm / 6'1""",Germany,Thomas Muller,Attacking Midfield,Vancouver Whitecaps,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/rhbgrp1702750958.jpg,twitter.com/esmuellert_,168 lbs,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q43666,www.instagram.com/esmuellert/,Right,,,,,,,

Widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential goalkeepers in the history of the sport, Neuer has been described as a ""sweeper-keeper"" because of his playing style and speed when rushing off his line to anticipate opponents, going out of the penalty area. He was named the best goalkeeper of the decade from 2011 to 2020 by IFFHS.

Neuer started his career at Schalke 04 where he won the DFB-Pokal and DFL-Ligapokal, and was appointed club captain in 2010. In 2011, he signed for Bayern Munich and has since won 28 trophies, including eleven Bundesliga titles and two UEFA Champions League titles in 2013 and 2020, both as part of trebles, being the only goalkeeper in history to achieve the European treble twice, additionally winning the second as club captain. In 2014, Neuer finished third in the voting for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. He was awarded the Best European Goalkeeper a record five times, and the IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper a joint-record five times, alongside Gianluigi Buffon and Iker Casillas. He was also named the Best FIFA Goalkeeper in 2020.

Neuer has set numerous records in the Bundesliga. He has the most clean sheets recorded in the competition, with 224. He also holds the most clean sheets in a single season, with 21 in the 2015–16 campaign. Furthermore, he was the fastest player to reach 100 Bundesliga clean sheets, doing so after only 183 appearances. Neuer is the only goalkeeper in Bundesliga history with more than 100 appearances to have conceded fewer goals than matches played.

Neuer was selected as Germany's number one goalkeeper for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. During the group stages, he only conceded a single goal. He provided the assist for Miroslav Klose's opening goal against England as Germany won 4–1. Four years later, Neuer won the 2014 FIFA World Cup with Germany as well as the Golden Glove award for being the best goalkeeper in the tournament. He was also named in its All-Star Team and Dream Team.

He signed for Villarreal in 2002, winning the UEFA Intertoto Cup twice. Reina moved on to Liverpool and made his debut in the 2005 UEFA Super Cup, which Liverpool won.

After starting his club career at Legia Warsaw, Szczęsny signed for Arsenal in January 2006, where he made his professional debut in 2009. After a spell on loan with Brentford the following season, he later became the capital club's first choice goalkeeper, winning two FA Cups and being the joint recipient of the 2013–14 Premier League Golden Glove alongside Petr Čech. He subsequently went on two consecutive season-long loans to Italian club Roma in 2015, where his performances earned him a move to reigning league champions Juventus in 2017. After serving mainly as a back-up to Gianluigi Buffon in his first season, during which he won a domestic double, he inherited the starting spot from the departed Buffon the following season, winning his second Serie A title; his performances also earned him a Yashin Trophy nomination in 2019. He won a third consecutive league title the following season, also winning the Serie A Best Goalkeeper Award. He briefly retired from professional football in 2024, before reversing his decision shortly after to join Barcelona.

Considered one of the best players in the world, he is known for his finishing, dribbling, and speed.

Salah started his senior career with Egyptian club El Mokawloon, departing shortly thereafter to join Swiss side Basel for an undisclosed fee. In Switzerland, his performances attracted Premier League side Chelsea, who signed him for in 2014. However, he was used sparingly in his debut season and was allowed to leave on loan to Serie A clubs Fiorentina and Roma, with the latter eventually signing him permanently for €15 million. Following his role in helping Roma to a second-placed finish and a club record points-tally in 2017, Salah returned to the Premier League to sign for Liverpool for a then club-record fee of £36.9 million.

In his second spell in England, Salah adapted his game from a natural winger to a forward, going on to break the Premier League scoring record for a 38-game season and subsequently receiving the Premier League Golden Boot after netting 32 goals in 36 league games. Salah's performances earned him a number of individual accolades, including the PFA Players' Player of the Year. He also came third in the 2018 Best FIFA Men's Player award. In the following season, he finished as the Premier League's joint-top goalscorer, and helped Liverpool win the 2019 UEFA Champions League. He then helped end the club's 30 year league title drought by winning the 2019-20 Premier League.

At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level. Following his performances at the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was named CAF Most Promising African Talent of the Year. Since then, he has helped Egypt reach the final of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, and was top scorer during CAF qualification to help the team qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Dubbed ""El Niño Maravilla"" (The Wonder Child), Sánchez began his senior club career playing for Cobreloa, aged 15, and signed with Udinese in 2006, aged 18; he won consecutive league titles while on loan to Colo-Colo and River Plate. Sánchez was the subject of a record association football transfer when he signed for Barcelona in 2011 in a transfer worth €37.5 million, becoming the most expensive Chilean player of all time. There, Sánchez won six trophies, including a La Liga title and a Copa del Rey. He then joined Arsenal in 2014 in a transfer worth £31.7 million (€35 million), and won two FA Cups, the 2015 PFA Fans' Player of the Year, and was voted into the 2015 PFA Team of the Year. In 2018, he moved to league rivals Manchester United in a swap deal; he signed for Inter Milan a year later, and won a Serie A title and a Coppa Italia. In August 2022, he signed for Ligue 1 club Marseille. Having played only one season for the French side, Sánchez returned to Inter Milan in the summer of 2023.

Sánchez made his senior international debut for Chile in 2006 at age 18, and has since earned 166 caps, appearing in eight major tournaments and becoming both his country's most capped player and all-time top goalscorer. He led Chile to their first victory in a major tournament by winning the 2015 Copa América, scoring the winning penalty in the final; he captained the team to a repeat of this triumph at the Copa América Centenario (2016), winning the Golden Ball for Best Player.",,169 cm,Chile,Alexis Sánchez,Centre-Forward,Udinese,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/m05tjc1718343405.jpg,twitter.com/Alexis_Sanchez,137 lbs,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q180553,www.instagram.com/alexis_officia1,,,,,,,,

 He previously played domestically at second- and third-tier level for Real Jaén, Atlético Madrid B, Almería B, Almería, Albacete and Elche, and helped Elche gain promotion to La Liga in 2020.

Club career
Jaén
Sánchez was born in Campillo de Arenas, in the province of Jaén in Andalusia. He learnt his football in the youth system of Real Jaén, and made his senior debut with the reserves in 2009–10 in the Primera Andaluza. He moved into the first team the following season, and appeared regularly for them in the third-tier Segunda División B.

Atlético Madrid B
On 14 July 2011, Sánchez signed a three-year deal with Atlético Madrid. He was allocated to Atlético's B team, who also played in the Segunda B. He played 18 matches in 2011–12, and represented the club at the 2012 U-20 Copa Libertadores in Peru. In what the player attributed to his performance at that tournament, he was called up by manager Diego Simeone for pre-season training with the first team ahead of the 2012–13 season. It was as close as he got to first-team action. He was a regular for Atlético B in the second and third years of his contract, and missed only three matches in 2013–14 as they avoided relegation via the play-out with the help of a Sánchez goal.

Almería
In June 2014, Sánchez signed a three-year contract with another top-flight club, Almería, where he was again recruited for their B team playing in the Segunda B. In his first season, he appeared twice for the first team in the 2014–15 Copa del Rey, the first of which was on 5 December when he started in a 4–3 away win against Real Betis, but he only played league football for the reserves.

Almería were relegated that season, and Sánchez was included in the first-team squad for 2015–16. He made his Segunda División debut on 6 September, as a second-half substitute for Quique González in a 2–1 home win over Osasuna, and went on to play 25 matches in all competitions.

Albacete and loan to Elche
On 18 January 2017, after being sparingly used during the first half of the season at UD Almería, Sánchez was loaned to division three club Albacete Balompié until June. On 28 June 2018, after helping to win promotion, Sánchez joined Albacete Balompié on a permanent basis,.

Under a week later, Sánchez was loaned to fellow Segunda División B club Elche CF on 4 August 2018, where he was to play a key role in Elche's promotion back to the second division.

On 26 June 2018, he signed a permanent two-year deal with the club on a free transfer.

Sánchez became a regular for the side, scoring 7 goals in 36 appearances during his first full season at the club at Segunda División level. In his second season, Elche were promoted back to La Liga for the first time in five years, defeating Girona FC in the play-offs.

Birmingham City
On 27 August 2020, Sánchez signed as a free agent for English Championship (second-tier) club Birmingham City; he agreed a three-year contract with the option of a fourth. He made his debut in the starting eleven for Birmingham's opening fixture of the Championship season, at home to Brentford on 12 September; after 37 minutes he took a whipped corner from which Jérémie Bela scored the only goal of the game with a glancing near-post header. He was named in the Championship Team of the Month for September, and in the first match of October, a draw away to Stoke City, he took the corner from which Harlee Dean headed the opening goal. Away to Cardiff City on 16 December, he ""ripped through their defence with a slaloming run as he skipped past three defenders and lashed the ball home left footed from the edge of the area"" to give Birmingham a 2–1 lead with his first goal for the club, but the match ended as a 3–2 defeat.",,1.71 m (5 ft 6 in),Spain,Iván Sánchez Aguayo,Midfielder,Valladolid,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/kwun0b1609533477.jpg,,64 kg,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q18637500,,,,,,,,,

Beginning his career at Avispa Fukuoka, Tomiyasu had a spell with Belgian club Sint-Truiden and Italian club Bologna before joining Arsenal in 2021. He was also called up for Japan's senior team in 2018, having previously played for various youth levels.

On 30 August 2018, Tomiyasu received his first international call-up from the Japan national team for the Kirin Challenge Cup 2018. It was not until 12 October 2018 when he made his Japan debut, starting the whole game, in a 3–0 win against Panama. Tomiyasu became the first teenager to start in the senior team since Ryo Miyaichi. A month later on 16 November 2018, he made his second appearance for the national side, in a 1–1 draw against Venezuela.

In December 2018, Tomiyasu was re-called to the Japanese squad for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. He made his tournament debut for the national side, starting the whole game and helped Japan win 3–2 against Turkmenistan. He helped Japan keep a clean sheet by beating Oman 1–0 win to advance to the knockout stage. He then scored his first goal for the national side, scoring from a header, in a 1–0 win against Saudi Arabia to reach the semi–finals. Tomiyasu later played two more matches of the tournament, which saw the national side reaching the final for the first time since 2011. In the AFC Asian Cup final against Qatar, he started and captained the side, as they lost 3–1, finishing as runner–up in the process.

Following the conclusion to the AFC Asian Cup tournament, Tomiyasu was called up to the squad ahead of the Copa América in Brazil. He started all three matches, playing in the centre–back position, as they were eliminated in the Group Stage. He later played three matches of 2019, helping the national side keep three clean sheets.

Almost a year absent, Tomiyasu was called up to the Japan squad on 6 October 2020. He started three out of the four matches for the national team by the end of the year.

Tomiyasu has two sisters. He was planning to follow in his sisters' footsteps by becoming a professional swimmer before switching to football instead, stating that he wanted to be a footballer. In his first press conference in Bologna, Tomiyasu said he began to learn Italian and asked the media to call him Tomi. By February 2020, Italian media Corriere Di Bologna reported that Tomiyasu already spoke Italian. In addition to Italian and his native Japanese, Tomiyasu also speaks English, having sharpened his English skills during his spell in Sint-Truiden.

Tomiyasu revealed that growing up, he idolised Javier Mascherano. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, Tomiyasu spoke out about his life during the pandemic and while the season was suspended, he exercised daily. On 12 May 2020, his former club, Avispa Fukuoka expressed their gratitude to Tomiyasu after he donated 1,000 masks to the club's academy.

Club career
Early career
Born in Jos, Simon is a product of the famed GBS Academy, the same football academy in Nigeria that produced the likes of Ahmed Musa. He was linked with Nigerian Premier League club Kaduna United, as many professional clubs around the world were also eager to sign him. On 10 May 2013, it was announced that Simon had signed a pre-contractual agreement with Dutch club AFC Ajax to join them in pre-season training, having previously been linked with Liverpool F.C. and Tottenham Hotspur. He made his first appearance for Ajax on 13 July 2013 in pre-season friendly match against De Graafschap, coming on as a substitute player and scoring the third and final goal in the 64th minute of the match, in a 3–0 away win. He made a further appearance on 17 July, playing for the reserves team Jong Ajax in a pre-season friendly match against Voorschoten '97, scoring the second goal in the 5–0 home win. On 25 July 2013, it was announced that Ajax would not sign the young Nigerian, ultimately waiving him from the pre-season roster. After the announcement discussions commenced with AS Trenčín; Ajax partner club in Slovakia, which is owned by former Ajax player Tschen La Ling.

AS Trenčín
On 13 January 2014, Simon signed three-year contract for Slovak side AS Trenčín. He would join his compatriot Kingsley Madu. He made his league debut in a 1–1 draw against MFK Košice starting on the right wing alongside Gino van Kessel who was on loan from Ajax. He made his International debut during the club's 2014–15 UEFA Europa League campaign, when he was introduced during the second preliminary round of the competition, in the home match against FK Vojvodina Novi Sad from Serbia (played at the stadium in Dubnica, Slovakia). Simon scored a hat trick on his debut in the 4–0 win at home. AS Trenčín would eventually get eliminated in the following round, drawing at home, and falling 2–1 away against Hull City.

In October 2014 ESPN sports prepared a scouting report on Moses Simon and the report linked the winger with a move to Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Hull City along with a potential return to Ajax. The situation evolved into a bidding war between Dutch club SC Heerenveen and K.A.A. Gent, with the later contractually securing the winger for three years.

Gent

Simon with KAA Gent, 2015
On 6 January 2015, it was announced that K.A.A. Gent had signed Moses Simon to a three-year contract. He made his debut for Gent on 17 January 2015 in a 3–1 win against Royal Mouscron-Péruwelz in league play. His second appearance occurred four days later in a 1–0 home win against Sporting Lokeren in the Belgian Cup, in which Simon was sent off 30 seconds after he entered the field. In his third league game, again versus Sporting Lokeren, Simon scored a hat trick after which he was named Belgian league player of the week. He quickly became a key player in coach Hein Vanhaezebrouck's formation and helped Gent win their first ever national Championship title in May 2015. Two months later, Simon assisted Laurent Depoitre's winning goal in the 2015 Belgian Super Cup against cup winners Club Brugge.

Levante
On 6 August 2018, Simon joined Spanish La Liga side Levante on a five-year contract. In March 2019 he said he was glad to be playing for the team.

Nantes
On 15 August 2019, Simon was loaned out to Ligue 1 club FC Nantes. At the end of the season, Nantes triggered the option to buy in Simon’s loan. He signed a four-year contract with the club.",,168 cm,Nigeria,Moses Simon,Forward,Nantes,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/j18tv41608669053.jpg,,146 lbs,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q15900645,,,,,,,,,

Xhaka began his career at hometown club Basel, winning the Swiss Super League in each of his first two seasons. He then moved to Bundesliga team Borussia Mönchengladbach in 2012, developing a reputation as a technically gifted player and natural leader alongside criticism for his temperament. He was made captain of Borussia Mönchengladbach in 2015 at the age of 22, leading the team to UEFA Champions' League qualification for a second successive season. He completed a high-profile transfer to Arsenal in May 2016 for a fee in the region of £30 million.

Xhaka was part of the Swiss team that won the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup. He made his senior debut in 2011 and has won over 100 caps, representing the nation at the FIFA World Cup in 2014 and 2018, and the UEFA European Championship in 2016 and 2020.

Granit Xhaka was born on 27 September 1992 in the city of Basel, Switzerland, into an ethnic Albanian family from Podujevo, Kosovo, then part of the FR Yugoslavia. The family moved from Podujevo to Basel, Switzerland that year where Granit and his older brother Taulant Xhaka were born.

Before making his international debut for Switzerland, Xhaka was still undecided whether to play for his birth country or Albania, and he complained to the Albanian sports media that FSHF was ignoring him while the Swiss Football Association was showing much more interest.

Xhaka debuted for Switzerland at Wembley Stadium against England in a 2–2 UEFA Euro 2012 qualification draw on 4 June 2011. On 15 November 2011, during his sixth international appearance, he scored his first international goal in the 1–0 away win against Luxembourg at the Stade Josy Barthel.

Switzerland also tried to select Xhaka to participate in the 2012 Olympic Football tournament, but he opted to stay at his new club for pre-season training. He participated in all ten of Switzerland's 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign matches, scoring both goals in a 2–0 defeat of Slovenia. On 2 June 2014, Xhaka was named in Switzerland's 2014 World Cup squad by national coach Ottmar Hitzfeld. In the team's second match, Xhaka scored in a 5–2 loss to France.

Xhaka was selected for Euro 2016, where Switzerland's campaign opened against Albania in Lens. Xhaka, whose team won 1–0, was playing against his brother Taulant. He was voted the man of the match. Xhaka played every minute of Switzerland's campaign, which ended in the round of 16 with a loss to Poland at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard; after a 1–1 draw he was the only player to not score in the penalty shootout, shooting wide.

Ahead of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, there was speculation that Xhaka could switch his allegiance to represent Kosovo, which had been accepted as a full member of FIFA and were allowed to play competitive matches for the first time. Xhaka, however, published an open letter stating that his participation in Euro 2016 had disqualified him from changing his allegiance, and he was thus tied to Switzerland.

Xhaka was named in manager Vladimir Petković's 23-man Swiss squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. On 22 June, he equalised with a long-range strike as the Swiss came from behind to defeat Serbia 2–1 in their second game. He and fellow goalscorer Xherdan Shaqiri, who is also of Kosovan descent, celebrated their goals by making an eagle gesture resembling the double headed eagle of the Albanian flag. FIFA fined each player 10,000 Swiss francs ""for unsporting behaviour contrary to the principles of fair-play"".

Xhaka was appointed as a temporary captain by Vladimir Petković in the absence of Stephan Lichtsteiner, which caused him to be criticised by former Swiss international Stéphane Henchoz, who claimed that Xhaka could not properly represent Switzerland due to his Albanian heritage, instead suggesting that Lichtsteiner, Yann Sommer, or Fabian Schär serve as captain. In September 2019, Xhaka offered his captaincy to Xherdan Shaqiri in an effort to get him to return to the national side.

Xhaka's older brother, Taulant, is also a professional footballer and plays for Basel and formerly the Albania national team.

In July 2017, Xhaka married his long-term partner, Leonita Lekaj. His wife gave birth to their daughter, Ayana, on 7 October 2019. They welcomed their second daughter, Laneya, on 24 April 2021.",www.facebook.com/GranitXhaka/,186 cm,Switzerland,Granit Xhaka,Defensive Midfield,Sunderland,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/xhgqbw1678275167.jpg,twitter.com/xhakagranit34,174 lbs,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q514427,www.instagram.com/granitxhaka,Left,,,,,,,

He is currently a free agent. 

Willian started his career at Corinthians, before joining Shakhtar Donetsk in August 2007 for a fee of €14million. In his six years at the club, he won honours including four Ukrainian Premier League titles and the UEFA Cup in 2009. In 2013, he briefly signed for Anzhi Makhachkala before joining Chelsea for £30million, winning the Premier League and League Cup in his second season in England.

Willian made his debut for Brazil in 2011 and has since represented his country at the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cups, as well as the 2015 Copa América, the Copa América Centenario, and the 2019 Copa América, a tournament Brazil won on home soil.

As a member of the under-20 Brazil team, Willian made his debut in the 2007 South American Youth Championship against Chile on 7 January 2007, which Brazil went on to win. In 2007, he was also selected for the FIFA U-20 World Cup, but Brazil were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Spain.

On 10 November 2011, Willian made his senior debut for Brazil in a friendly match against Gabon. On 16 November 2013, he scored his first international goal in a 5–0 win over Honduras in Miami, Florida.

On 7 May 2014, Willian was selected as part of the 23-man squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He came on at half-time in extra time of the round of 16 match against Chile in Belo Horizonte for his Chelsea teammate Oscar, and took a penalty in the shootout which he put wide of the goal, although Brazil nonetheless advanced.

At the 2015 Copa América, Willian assisted Roberto Firmino's decisive goal in the 2–1 win over Venezuela in Santiago, a result which sent Brazil into the quarterfinals as group winners.

On 5 May 2016, he was named by Brazil manager Dunga among the 23-man list for the Copa América Centenario to be held in the United States.

In May 2018 he was named in Tite's final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

On 7 June 2019, he received a late call-up for the 2019 Copa América to replace the injured Neymar.

Willian is Afro-Brazilian and is married to Vanessa Martins. They have twin daughters, Valentina and Manuella. Like many Brazilian footballers, Willian is a devout Christian.

In April 2016, Willian was named in the Panama Papers.

On 13 October 2016, Willian's mother, Dona Zezé, died at the age of 57.

Club career
Trejo was born in Santiago del Estero. A product of Boca Juniors' youth system he only played once for its first team but, in the game against Club Almagro, he scored in a 2–3 away loss after a mere minutes on the pitch – the match was suspended after 63 minutes.

In late December 2006, Trejo was bought by RCD Mallorca in Spain, still having not signed his first professional contract. Boca sustained otherwise and the case was taken to FIFA, which ultimately decided for the Balearic Islands club. He made his first appearance in La Liga on 8 April 2007, against Getafe CF: having come on as a 90th-minute substitute, he managed to find the net for a final 2–0 home victory.

Sparingly used in the following seasons, Trejo managed to score in the 2007–08 edition of the Copa del Rey in a 2–1 home win over Real Madrid (3–1 aggregate). After an unassuming 2008–09, he was loaned for the following campaign to second division side Elche CF.

On 15 August 2010 a similar move ensued, with Trejo joining Rayo Vallecano in the same level. He returned to the top flight in the 2011–12 season, scoring four goals in 33 contests for Sporting de Gijón but suffering team relegation.

In the summer of 2012, Premier League's West Ham United made an attempt to buy Trejo, but the deal fell apart. One year later he eventually left Spain, going on to spend several years in the French Ligue 1 with Toulouse FC after agreeing to a four-year contract.

On 21 June 2017, six years after leaving, Trejo returned to Rayo as director of football David Cobeño's first signing.",,1.77 m (5 ft 10 in),Argentina,Oscar Trejo,Midfielder,Vallecano,https://r2.thesportsdb.com/images/media/player/thumb/xwemxm1551709536.jpg,,172 lbs,http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q167348,,,,,,,,,

He began his career at his local club VV Spirit, and debuted as a professional for Feyenoord aged 17. He spent five seasons at the Eredivisie club, serving briefly as captain, before joining Lazio in July 2014.

A full international since 2012, De Vrij has earned over 50 caps for the Netherlands. He was part of the Dutch team that finished third at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and was selected for the Castrol Performance Index Team of the Tournament. He also played at UEFA Euro 2020.

De Vrij grew up in Ouderkerk aan den IJssel. He is the youngest son of Jan de Vrij, who played for local club VV Spirit, where Stefan de Vrij started his career. His older brothers Niels and Eric played football in their youth and continued to different career paths.

On 7 May 2012, De Vrij was named in the provisional list of 36 players for the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament, one of nine uncapped players to be chosen by Netherlands manager Bert van Marwijk as part of the preliminary squad. He did not make the final cut. On 15 August 2012, De Vrij made his debut under new manager Louis van Gaal in the 4–2 loss against Belgium in a friendly match.

He was one of four Feyenoord defenders named in Louis van Gaal's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In the Netherlands' first game of the tournament, against Spain on 13 June, the referee gave a questionable penalty kick after 26 minutes after Diego Costa stood on De Vrij's foot and fell. Xabi Alonso converted this penalty to put Spain 1–0 up. The Dutch fought back, and De Vrij scored their third goal, the first of his international career, as they eventually won 5–1. De Vrij played in all of the Netherlands' matches as they eventually finished in third place. He and Arjen Robben were the two Dutch players selected to the Team of the Tournament.

In the Netherlands' first game of UEFA Euro 2016 qualification away to the Czech Republic on 9 September 2014, De Vrij equalised with a header from Daley Blind's cross but the Dutch lost 2–1.
