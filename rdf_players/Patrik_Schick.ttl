    schema:description """Patrik Schick (born 24 January 1996) is a Czech professional footballer who plays as a striker for Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen and the Czech Republic national team.\r
\r
Born in Prague, Schick began his career with local club Sparta Prague, rising through their youth ranks, before making his senior debut as a teenager. He spent the 2015â€“16 season on loan with Bohemians 1905, from where he moved at the age of 20 to Sampdoria in Italy. After his debut season in Italy, he moved to Roma in 2017. Having spent three years in Italy, Schick moved to Germany in 2019 to join RB Leipzig on a season-long loan before moving to Bayer Leverkusen on a permanent basis in September 2020. There he won a domestic double of the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal in 2024.\r
\r
Formerly an international at under-16, under-17, under-18, under-19, and under-21 levels, Schick made his senior debut for the Czech Republic in May 2016 at the age of 20. He has since helped the national team reach the quarter-finals of the European Championship in 2021, where he won both the Goal of the Tournament and the Silver Boot awards as the joint-highest goalscorer of the tournament."""@en ;
