    schema:description """Ionuț Andrei Radu (born 28 May 1997), known as Ionuț Radu or Andrei Radu, is a Romanian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Serie A club Venezia.\r
\r
Radu began his professional career at Inter Milan, his senior output during his first stint consisting of only one match. He was loaned to Avellino in 2017, and the following year joined Genoa also on loan but with an obligation to buy. In the summer of 2019, the Nerazzurri activated his buy-back clause before loaning him again to the latter club and then to Parma, Cremonese, Auxerre and Bournemouth, respectively.\r
\r
In international football, Radu led Romania under-21 to the semi-finals of the UEFA Euro 2019 as their captain, and as a result was awarded the Romanian Footballer of the Year trophy. He then made his full debut for the country in September 2022, in a 1–1 Nations League draw with Finland."""@en ;
