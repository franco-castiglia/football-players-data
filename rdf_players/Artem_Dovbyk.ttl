    schema:description """Artem Oleksandrovych Dovbyk (Ukrainian: Артем Олександрович Довбик; born 21 June 1997) is a Ukrainian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Serie A club Roma and the Ukraine national team.\r
\r
Club career\r
Cherkaskyi Dnipro\r
Born in Cherkasy, Ukraine, Dovbyk is a product of the FC Cherkaskyi Dnipro academy after graduating from the Olympic Reserve Specialized Sports School Slavutych in Cherkasy. His professional debut Dovbyk made with his home team in 2014. He won the 2014–15 Ukrainian Second League, scoring 7 goals.\r
\r
Dnipro\r
In summer 2015, he signed a contract with FC Dnipro, but in April 2016, he was then sent on a three-month loan to Moldovan club FC Zaria Bălți, where he won the Moldovan Cup. He would go on to score a joint team high 6 goals as he won the 2016–17 Ukrainian Premier League Best Young Player award. This prompted Ukraine national team coach Andriy Shevchenko to call him up for 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers.\r
\r
Midtjylland\r
When Dnipro were relegated due to incurring debt, Dovbyk stayed with the club. He would go on to score 12 goals in 13 games in the Ukrainian Second League, gaining interest from foreign clubs, and in 2018 he joined Danish club FC Midtjylland on a free transfer. In 2018 with FC Midtjylland Dovbyk became a national champion and in 2019 becoming a national cup holder. On 2 September 2019, he was loaned out to SønderjyskE for the 2019–20 season. With SønderjyskE, Dovbyk for the second time became a Danish cup holder.\r
\r
Dnipro-1\r
After a lack of regular playing time and dry run-on scoresheet, in 2020 Dovbyk returned to Ukraine signing with the recently established SC Dnipro-1 that was just promoted to the Ukrainian premiers in previous season. While his league performance was somewhat under par from what expected, Dovbyk made a nice score run in the Ukrainian Cup netting 4 goals in three games, becoming one of the three top scorers in the tournament.\r
\r
In 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine had started, the 2021–22 season was cancelled. Dovbyk made a temporary move to Dynamo Kyiv who were playing charity matches in Europe for the rest of the season to stay in form.\r
\r
Girona\r
On 6 August 2023, Dovbyk signed for Spanish club Girona by signing a contract until 2028, for a reported fee of €7m, to be the most expensive player in club's history. On 12 August, he scored a goal on his debut in a 1–1 away draw against Real Sociedad."""@en ;
