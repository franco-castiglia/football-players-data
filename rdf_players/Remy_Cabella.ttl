\r
Rémy Joseph Cabella was born on 8 March 1990 in Ajaccio, Corsica, to an Italian father and a Corsican mother. He started his youth career at local club Gazélec Ajaccio before joining Montpellier's academy at the age of 14, winning the 2009 Coupe Gambardella with their under-19 team.\r
\r
Cabella was named on the stand-by list for France's 2014 FIFA World Cup squad. He made his international debut coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for Yohan Cabaye in a 4–0 friendly match win over Norway on 28 May 2014 at the Stade de France. On 6 June, Cabella replaced the injured Franck Ribéry in France's 2014 World Cup squad. The team lost to Germany in the quarter-finals on 4 July, and Cabella did not enter the field of play in all of their five matches in that tournament.\r

After signing for Newcastle, Cabella picked up three more caps for France in September and October 2014, in friendly matches against Spain, Serbia, and Armenia."""@en ;
