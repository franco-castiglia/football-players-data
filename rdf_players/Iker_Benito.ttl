    schema:description """Iker Benito Sánchez (born 10 August 2002) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a right winger for Segunda División club CD Mirandés on loan from CA Osasuna.\r
\r
Born in Miranda de Ebro, Burgos, Castile and León, Benito joined CA Osasuna's youth setup in 2018, after a period on trial at Athletic Bilbao, from CD Pamplona. On 13 May of the following year, he signed a two-year professional contract with the former club, with an option for a further two campaigns.\r
\r
Benito was promoted to the reserves in May 2020, and made his senior debut on 25 October, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2–0 Segunda División B away loss against CD Tudelano. He scored his first senior goal on 25 September 2021, netting the B's second in a 2–0 away win over AD San Juan in the Segunda División RFEF championship.\r
\r
Benito made his first team – and La Liga – debut on 19 January 2022, replacing fellow youth graduate Kike Barja late into a 2–0 loss at RC Celta de Vigo. On 24 June, he renewed his contract until 2025.\r
\r
On 1 July 2023, Benito was loaned to Segunda División side FC Andorra for the season. He returned to the Rojillos roughly one year later, but moved to CD Mirandés also in a temporary deal on 2 January 2025, after being rarely used."""@en ;
